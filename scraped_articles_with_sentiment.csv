environment/2020/jul/02/transport-slump-during-lockdown-reduced-australias-carbon-pollution-by-7-in-april-but-experts-warn-of-rebound,Environment,environment/2020/jul/02/transport-slump-during-lockdown-reduced-australias-carbon-pollution-by-7-in-april-but-experts-warn-of-rebound,Exclusive: An audit shows the drop in carbon pollution was due to a decline in sales of fuel for light vehicles and domestic aviation,"Greenhouse gas emissions from Australian cars slumped by more than a third and emissions from aircraft dropped by three-quarters as the country went into partial lockdown in April, cutting national carbon pollution by about 7% for the month, an audit has found. It confirmed that the recession will lead to a notable fall in national emissions this year. But experts believe the drop is likely to be limited and could be short-term given much of the economy – including big industry and manufacturing – has largely continued to operate through the coronavirus pandemic and road transport has begun to increase. The Australia Institute, which publishes the monthly national energy emissions audit by independent energy analyst Hugh Saddler, said transport emissions are likely to rebound unless the Morrison government releases and backs policies it has promised to support electric vehicles and improve fuel quality. Saddler, a consultant and honorary associate professor at ANU’s Crawford School of Public Policy, found transport emissions fell sharply due to a 36% fall in sales of petrol, liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and diesel used in light vehicles and a 77% drop in domestic aviation fuel consumption. The fall in transport emissions was about 3m tonnes. It is equivalent to about 7% of total monthly national emissions, 5% of annual transport emissions and 0.6% of total annual national emissions. Emissions from electricity fell another 1.9m tonnes, but Saddler found this was not due to Covid-19. While official data suggests industrial and small business energy use dropped in April and May, household use increased as people stayed home. Saddler said the two changes effectively cancelled each other out, leaving total electricity consumption mostly unchanged, save for a slight fall due to the weather being more mild this year than last. Where there has been a change is in the mix of types of electricity. The proportion of coal-fired power in the national electricity grid, not counting rooftop solar, fell to 66% – the first time it has fallen below 70% since the introduction of a centralised power supply. The share of renewable energy grew to about 25%, reflecting the surge of investment in large-scale solar and wind in 2017 and 2018 triggered by the 23% national renewable energy target. Spending on new large-scale renewable energy fell by about 50% last year after that target was met and not renewed. Saddler said the fall in transport emissions was as extraordinary and historic as the event that caused it. “Obviously that’s completely predictable and expected,” he said. He said carbon dioxide from cars – the biggest chunk of transport emissions – was likely to rebound as cars returned to roads across most of the country, but it was difficult to assess what impact the greater number of people working from home would have on that. “It will come back up, but will go back to up to where it was? I’m not sure,” Saddler said. Richie Merzian, Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, said data in the report highlighted the reduction in emissions that would possible if governments addressed transport pollution. He said there was no policy to address emissions from the sector, with a national electric vehicle strategy having been delayed, a liquid fuel security review completed but yet to be released and nothing happening to improve fuel quality. He said Australia, without an auto-manufacturing industry, was a “car-taker not car-maker” and risked being unprepared if it did not plan as global car companies shifted to electric vehicles. “Now is the ideal time to drive change in our transport sector by electrifying our cars and buses,” he said. “The federal government could be investing in necessary infrastructure to smooth the inevitable transition away from fossil-fuelled transport, while building the know-how and jobs Australia needs for our electric future.” Analyses before Covid-19 hit suggested the government was not on track to meet its 2030 emissions reduction target – a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels – without using a carbon accounting loophole. According to revised emissions data, national emissions were down just 1.5% since the Coalition was elected in 2013.",4
australia-news/2021/nov/03/australia-puts-fossil-fuel-company-front-and-centre-at-cop26,Environment,australia-news/2021/nov/03/australia-puts-fossil-fuel-company-front-and-centre-at-cop26,Criticism of Santos pavilion display comes as Coalition confirms it will not join global pledge to cut methane,"The Australian government has been criticised for prominently hosting a fossil fuel company at its pavilion at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. The condemnation came as the Morrison government confirmed it would not join about 90 countries in backing the official launch of a global pledge to reduce emissions of methane – a potent greenhouse gas leaked during gas and coal extraction and released by livestock – by 30% by 2030. The Australian pavilion in the Scottish Event Campus exhibition centre has been a hub of activity during the first two days of the summit. With numbers in the main plenary hall limited, Australians gathered there to watch Scott Morrison’s address to the conference on Monday. Space in the pavilion has been dedicated to Australian businesses, including Andrew Forrest’s green-hydrogen focused Fortescue Future Industries, Sun Cable, which plans to send solar energy captured in the Northern Territory to Singapore and Mineral Carbonation International. Alongside them is the oil and gas giant Santos. At the front of the pavilion on Tuesday was a Santos demonstration of its Moomba carbon capture and storage project in outback South Australia. Santos confirmed on Monday that the A$220m development would go ahead after the government announced it could receive carbon credit revenue from taxpayers through the emissions reduction fund. Australia’s energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, joined Santos’ chief executive, Kevin Gallagher, at the pavilion to trumpet the announcement. The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who is in Glasgow as the chair of the Fortescue Future Industries, said it was “a pity” Australia had not signed up to the pledge and “a joke” that Santos had been given prime placement. “Look at the Australian stand – you’ve got a gas company highlighted apparently at the insistence of the energy minister, who thinks that our energy policy should be all about burning gas,” Turnbull told reporters. “The whole object is to stop burning fossil fuels. “We’ve got to cut all greenhouse gas emissions, methane and CO2, particularly. We can’t keep on pretending that this is a problem we can push out on to the future. We are living with the reality of global warming now.” Taylor spoke at the pavilion alongside the Santos chief while launching the government’s latest low-emissions technology statement – an annual update of its technology-driven approach to climate change. CCS is one of six priority technologies chosen to get government support. The minister said Santos’ CCS development at Moomba, which if successful will capture 1.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from 2024, was a “very elegant project” that would allow it to produce gas while reducing emissions. Taylor said there were many different types of CCS but it was initially likely to be used in gas production sites and in the development of “blue” hydrogen using gas. “We can do exactly the same at Moomba and other places in the production of hydrogen,” he said. “This is not new, it’s very, very important, it’s going to be particularly important for the gas industry.” Asked about the global methane pledge, he said Australia’s focus was “whole of economy, all gasses”. “We’re not setting sector-specific targets and we’re not setting gas-specific targets,” he said. Taylor last week claimed signing up to the pledge would mean cut agricultural herd numbers, and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said the only way to meet it would be to “start shooting your cattle”. Bill Hare, the chief executive of research firm Climate Analytics, said this was not correct. The government’s 2050 net-zero emissions plan has been criticised for including no new policies and relying on new technology to make emissions cuts in the 2030s and 40s. Its support for CCS technology – both burying greenhouse gases from industrial sites kilometres underground and potentially using captured carbon dioxide to make products – includes $250m for a “CCS technologies and hubs” program. Australian governments have committed about $4bn in funding for CCS over time, but it is yet to prove commercially viable at scale. The country has one operating CCS plant, at Chevron’s Gorgon gas development in Western Australia. It has suffered repeated delays and captures only a portion of the emissions at the site. The Greens’ environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, who is also in Glasgow, said the Morrison government was spending Cop26 “busy hanging out with fossil fuel executives and hosting PR stunts for the gas industry”. The Australian Conservation Foundation said Australia was acting “shamelessly”. “Make no mistake, the Morrison government’s preoccupation with CCS is about keeping coal and gas Australia’s energy system longer, and delaying the transition to renewable energy with storage,” said ACF’s climate program manager, Gavan McFadzean. Taylor said the government was backing renewable energy by adding “ultra low-cost solar” as a priority in the new technology statement, as flagged last week when the government released its plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Cutting the price of solar further would be key to producing hydrogen made with renewable energy at scale, he said. “We welcome all forms of clean hydrogen production – green, blue – they are important,” he said. “You will see green growing rapidly over time, we certainly hope.”",3

New government data released Monday shows sectors where emissions fell sharply in 2020 due to factors beyond the government’s control – the global pandemic and the end of a sharp drought – were starting to rebound. In the final quarter of 2020, transport emissions – which includes road and rail movement as well as domestic air travel – rose by 11% on the previous three months, reflecting the easing of lockdown restrictions and increases in domestic air travel. Increasing levels of solar and wind energy was continuing to push out coal in the electricity sector that accounts for a third of the country’s emissions. Emissions in this sector have dropped 21% since 2009. A milder December meant people had used less power for cooling than usual, helping cut emissions further. But the energy department data says long-term trends for other high-emitting sectors are heading in the wrong direction. Since 1990, the department data shows the annual energy used mainly to produce goods in heavy industry has risen 52% and transport emissions have gone up 43%. The department said there was also likely to be a growth in emissions from agriculture in coming quarters as sheep and cattle stocks increased following an easing of drought conditions and crop production went up. Fugitive emissions from gases escaping into the atmosphere along the production and supply chain of oil, coal and gas fell 9% in 2020 from the previous year but were also rising long term as a result of the LNG industry, the government said. Energy analyst Hugh Saddler, honorary associate professor at Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, said: “The only thing the government can take credit for here is not completely blocking the transition in the electricity sector.” But he warned for the transition from coal to renewables to continue to deliver gains, much more would need to be done to allow the electricity network to accommodate more renewables. He said the Covid-19 pandemic had caused the fall in transport emissions, which the government’s report says is now rising again. Australia’s globally significant LNG export industry was increasing the emissions in the stationary energy sector. Burning gas in order to provide the energy needed to compress it into LNG for export was “putting a big kick up on Australia’s stationery energy emissions”, said Saddler. In a statement, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said despite the “upward pressure from growth in exports and industry”, emissions per capita and the emissions intensity of the economy were “at their lowest levels in three decades”. Since 1990, Australia’s rate of land clearing has fallen rapidly and, while still high, is responsible for the biggest fall in the country’s annual greenhouse gas accounts. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said Taylor’s “crowing about emissions reductions” relied on “a renewables transition he’s trying to slow, a Covid-related transport shift that he cannot prolong and a coal production drop that he’s trying to reverse”. Bandt said while coal emissions were falling, “gas is pushing up climate pollution” and the government’s “hostility to electric vehicles” meant transport pollution would keep growing. He said: “The lack of an EV plan is costing us. Transport pollution is going back up and will continue to do so while the Liberals keep waging war on EVs. “We need 75% reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2035, but today’s data shows we’re nowhere near that.” Taylor said the government would “meet and beat our 2030 Paris target” to cut emissions by 26-28% compared with 2005 levels. The Monday data, he said, showed Australia was now 20% below 2005 levels. Australia’s 2030 target has remained the same since 2015.",0
australia-news/2020/oct/12/net-zero-emissions-target-for-australia-could-launch-63bn-investment-boom,Environment,australia-news/2020/oct/12/net-zero-emissions-target-for-australia-could-launch-63bn-investment-boom,Modelling shows moving towards a net zero emissions economy would unlock financial prospects in sectors including renewables and manufacturing,"Australia could unlock an investment boom of $63bn over the next five years if it aligns its climate policies with a target of net zero emissions by 2050, according to new economic modelling. The analysis, by the Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC), finds the investment opportunity created by an orderly transition to a net zero emissions economy would reach hundreds of billions of dollars by 2050 across sectors including renewable energy, manufacturing, carbon sequestration and transport. However, if the country keeps to its current targets and climate policies, investment worth $43bn would be lost over the next five years, growing to $250bn by 2050. The Investor Group on Climate Change represents investors in Australia and New Zealand who are focused on the effect of the climate crisis on the financial value of investments. Among its membership are institutional investors with funds under management worth more than $2 trillion. The organisation commissioned the consultancy Energetics to examine the domestic investment opportunities that would arise from an orderly transition to net zero emissions by 2050. The report finds a net zero scenario would unlock $63bn in investment over the next five years, including $15bn in manufacturing, $6bn in transport infrastructure such as charging stations, and $3bn in domestic green hydrogen production, as companies and governments moved towards the stronger emissions goal. Carbon sequestration – or carbon farming – would emerge as a major investment asset class, with estimated investment worth $33bn in nature-based solutions such as tree planting and assisted regeneration of deforested land. The investment potential would reach hundreds of billions of dollars over the longer term to 2050, including $385bn in clean electricity, $350bn in domestic green hydrogen, $104bn in transport infrastructure and $102bn in carbon sequestration. “What it shows is that the investment opportunities extend well beyond just the renewables industry,” said Erwin Jackson, the IGCC’s director of policy. “Renewables are the backbone of the transition but there are massive opportunities in other sectors such as manufacturing, restoring the land, and electrification of transport.” The report, which targets governments, companies, investors and financial regulators, says its estimates are conservative because they do not factor in the export potential of industries such as clean hydrogen. It argues that if governments set stable policy, and companies and investors collaborate to align their decisions with the goals of the Paris agreement, then billions of dollars over the short and long term could support the jobs and wealth of millions of Australians, particularly in regional areas. The Morrison government has refused to commit Australia to a net zero emissions target and has focused its climate policy on a new technology roadmap covering hydrogen, energy storage, “low carbon” steel and aluminium, carbon capture and storage, and soil carbon. Under the roadmap, the government claims it will invest $18bn in technologies over 10 years. The IGCC report notes that more than half of Australia’s two-way trading partners have set targets to reach net zero emissions by mid-century. It warns that a business as usual “hothouse” scenario in Australia – with no net zero emissions target – would produce $43bn less in investment over five years and $250bn less by 2050 than what would be possible with a net zero target. “Put bluntly, capital is global and it wants to invest in climate change solutions because they see it as delivering more on their long term investments,” Jackson said. “They’re going to invest more in countries that have durable, credible policies to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.” John Connor, the chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute, said the reality Australia faced was its economy was running “below capacity and it needs a new direction”. He said clean technologies like renewable energy and transport represented significant opportunities for Australia in a post-carbon world and the country’s vast land mass, with landscapes in need of regeneration, gave it a competitive advantage in carbon sequestration. “We can either coast off the cliff into the hothouse of economic and climate disaster, or we can turn a corner towards an orderly transition and the opportunities that are there,” Connor said.",18
environment/2021/jun/08/gas-and-coal-companies-among-recipients-of-50m-in-coalition-grants-from-carbon-capture-fund,Environment,environment/2021/jun/08/gas-and-coal-companies-among-recipients-of-50m-in-coalition-grants-from-carbon-capture-fund,Santos liquified natural gas scheme among six projects to receive public support,"The Morrison government has announced the first $50m in grants from a new carbon capture, use and storage (CCS) fund, including awarding up to $15m to gas company Santos and $5m to a coal power project owned by mining giant Glencore. The funding is drawn from a promised $263.7m for the controversial technology, which most often involves capturing industrial greenhouse gas emissions as they are released and injecting them underground. Santos will receive public support for its long-mooted Moomba liquified natural gas (LNG) export project in the Cooper Basin in South Australia. The company says it is expected to store 1.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. Up to $5m is dedicated to the Carbon Transport and Storage Company, a project wholly owned by Glencore, to help trial the viability of CCS at a Queensland coal-fired power station and develop a geological storage basin in the Surat Basin. Three other projects to win backing promise to use the captured CO2 in product development, rather than store it underground. The sixth is for Australia’s first demonstration of direct-air capture and storage, an energy-intensive “negative emissions” technology that is intended to draw emissions from the atmosphere and bury them underground. CCS has been a contentious area of public policy in Australia, having been promised billions of dollars in public funding for little result. The first significant project in Australia, Chevron’s Gorgon liquefied natural gas development in the Pilbara, started operating in 2019 after years of delay before it stopped working properly earlier this year. Globally, it has not proven commercially viable in reducing emissions from coal power, and supporters say it is more likely to play a role at industrial sites. Both the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have said it has a role in addressing the climate crisis. Opponents say it has failed to deliver on scale over two decades and takes funding away from cheaper clean technology. Announcing the funding on Tuesday, the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said there had been “overwhelming demand”, with the government having received applications to support $1.2bn of private investment. It was “further proof of the viability and importance of carbon capture technologies”, he said. “The projects we have supported through this program include a number of exciting, Australian-first technology demonstrations,” he said. Santos said its grant was recognition of the “national and international significance” its $210m CCS project in the South Australian outback. Its chief executive, Kevin Gallagher, said it would be one of the cheapest CCS projects in the world, with burial costing $25 to $30 a tonne and pushing for the Morrison government’s goal of less than $20 a tonne. Gallagher said he was “looking forward” to a final investment decision on the project later this year. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy director, said the announcement suggested the government’s policy was “failed technologies, not taxes”. “We know CCS has already benefited from $1.3bn in support and there is not a single fully operational project in Australia to show from it,” he said. “Even the department of energy admitted that they don’t expect any emissions reductions from CCS in the next 20 years under the government’s technology investment roadmap.” Taylor last year named CCS as one of five priorities that would receive taxpayer backing through the government’s “technology, not taxes” approach to emissions reduction. Others nominated in the government’s first low-emissions technology statement were “clean” hydrogen, soil carbon, energy storage and low-emissions steel and aluminium. The projects to receive funding other than Santos and Glencore were: Up to $14.6m for Mineral Carbonation International to help build a mobile demonstration plant on Kooragang Island, New South Wales, that uses CO2 to produce manufacturing and construction materials, such as concrete, plasterboard and fire-retardant materials. Up to $9m for Energy Developments Pty Ltd to use CO2 emitted from the production of biomethane at landfill sites in cement carbonation curing. Up to $4m for Corporate Carbon Advisory Pty Ltd for Australia’s first demonstration of a direct-air capture and storage project to geologically sequester CO2 in an existing injection well in Moomba, South Australia. Up to $2.4m for Boral Limited for a pilot-scale CO2-use project to improve the quality of recycled concrete, masonry and steel slag aggregates at New Berrima, NSW. Taylor said the six projects would create “close to 470 direct jobs and deliver $412m of investment, much of this in regional areas”. The Morrison government also announced that the Australian Renewable Energy Agency would invest $15m in a pilot “solar hydro” power plant at Carwarp, in northwest Victoria. Taylor said the “innovative” technology, to be built by the company RayGen, would offer up to 17 hours energy storage. Australia’s industrial emissions have risen significantly since 2005, the baseline year against which the country pledged to cut carbon pollution under the Paris climate agreement, but overall emissions are down due to reductions from land-clearing and electricity generation. Official projections released in December said the Morrison government was not yet on track to meet its 2030 target, a 26% to 28% cut. ",2
business/2021/mar/19/coles-shuns-coal-supermarket-giant-vows-to-source-all-its-electricity-from-renewables-by-2025,Business,business/2021/mar/19/coles-shuns-coal-supermarket-giant-vows-to-source-all-its-electricity-from-renewables-by-2025,Australian climate campaigners hail decision: ‘An announcement like this changes the national story’,"The supermarket giant Coles has pledged to source all its electricity from renewable sources across its brands by 2025 after signing another agreement to buy clean power from a Victorian windfarm. The move means all three of Australia’s major supermarkets, including Woolworths and Aldi, will be sourcing all their electricity from renewables by 2025 at the latest. Climate change campaigners said the announcement showed a significant shift was occurring across Australia’s corporate landscape. Coles Group’s chief executive, Steven Cain, told Guardian Australia the commitment, which builds on the group’s previous deals to buy renewable power, was responding to calls from staff and customers but also shareholders and investors. “There’s no doubt that in out shareholder meetings people are asking more questions about sustainability because investors around the world – who themselves have investors – are asking, are we putting our money to work in a responsible fashion,” he said. “There’s more money available to companies that are doing this.” Coles said a deal announced on Friday to buy large-scale electricity generation certificates from Lal Lal Wind Farms meant 45% of its electricity consumption would come from renewables by financial year 2023. From July 2022, more than 90% of Coles’ Queensland electricity would come from renewables. The group aimed to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. A new branding initiative – Together to Zero – would become a key part of the group’s “visual identity”, with a logo designed by the Bundjalung/Biripi artist Nikita Ridgeway. Cain said other moves included adding more doors to fridges to improve efficiency, replacing climate warming refrigeration gases and improving logistics so that vehicles returning to distribution centres did not return empty but picked up from suppliers along the way. “Over time we will see the move to electric vehicles – that’s maybe not too far away,” Cain said, adding that autonomous electric vehicles and eventually drones would play a role in cutting future transport emissions. Coles said it aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions caused directly and indirectly by its energy use by more than 75% by the end of financial year 2030, from a 2020 baseline. Coles group includes its supermarkets, Coles Express outlets and the alcohol retailers Liquorland, Vintage Cellars and First Choice Liquor. Woolworths Group, which includes supermarkets and other retailers including BWS, Big W and Dan Murphys, said in November all its electricity would come from renewables by 2025. Aldi says it is now buying enough renewable energy certificates to cover its electricity use from this year. Greenpeace said Coles had become the first major retailer to sign a power purchase deal in 2019, when it agreed to source 10% of its electricity from three New South Wales solar farms. The environmental group’s chief executive, David Ritter, said Australia could not underestimate the significance of announcements made by major businesses like Coles. “We know Coles is one of the most trusted brands in Australia and so an announcement like this changes the national story,” he said. “It says very clearly that big businesses trust their profitability and corporate reputation with clean energy because it’s a better option for them. “This shows that we have a federal government that is isolated from where the mainstream of corporate Australia is heading.” Greenpeace said it wanted Coles to now join an international alliance called RE100 of companies committing to 100% clean energy. Woolworths is an RE100 signatory. A report for the UN on Friday ranked Australia as the worst of the world’s 50 largest economies for spending on a “green recovery” from the Covid pandemic. The director of climate and environment at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, Dan Gocher, said Coles’ previous emissions targets were “underwhelming” but “it has really delivered with this set of commitments”. “Coles is not an insignificant emitter – it produced 1.6m tonnes of CO2e in FY2020 – and ranks in the top 50 of Australia’s largest polluters,” he said. He said Coles needed to follow Rio Tinto, Santos and Woodside in adopting a pledge to allow its shareholders an annual vote on climate strategies. “This latest flurry of climate announcements from Australian companies shows the penny has finally dropped on climate risk management. The federal government would be wise to take heed.”",3

The Conservatives promised £12bn (A$21.8bn) for a 10-point plan to combat the climate crisis, including building enough offshore windfarms to run every home in Britain, installing 600,000 efficient heat pumps a year to replace dirty old heaters, and developing new small nuclear reactors. The headline-grabber was confirmation that the UK would accelerate the shift to electric vehicles (EVs) by banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, a decade earlier than previously planned. Johnson promised £2.4bn (A$4.3bn) for grants to lower the cost of EVs, install charging infrastructure across the country and boost the battery manufacturing industry. Rhapsodising in the Financial Times, the UK prime minister said now was the time to plan for “a green recovery” that would turn the UK into “the world’s number one centre for green technology and finance, creating the foundations for decades of economic growth”. He suggested the plan could spur massive private investment and support 250,000 jobs. “Imagine Britain when a green industrial revolution has helped to level up the country,” he wrote. “Green and growth can go hand-in-hand. So let us meet the most enduring threat to our planet with one of the most innovative and ambitious programs of job creation we have known.” Reaction in Britain was mixed, with some critics saying it didn’t go far enough. While the government was praised for sending an important signal ahead of the country hosting a major international climate conference in Glasgow next year, the Labour opposition described it as “deeply, deeply disappointing” for its lack of ambition. Analyses found it was not enough to put the country on a path to decarbonisation, as Johnson had promised. Both the ambition and the critical response were light years from the political debate in Australia, where the major parties argue fossil fuel industries will continue for decades and climate action remains primarily framed in terms of the short-term cost. This contrast is not new. British emissions fell 29% while the economy grew strongly over the past decade, while in Australia they dropped 10% and only a tick more than 2% since the Coalition was elected in 2013. But the divide is particularly stark on transport and the shift to electric vehicles. Only 0.6% of new cars sold in Australia are electric. This compares with between 5% and 8% in many comparable countries and about 60% in Norway, a small market that went hard early in backing the technology. There are only about 20,000 EVs on Australian roads. Federal and state governments have begun rolling out plug-in charging infrastructure but unlike other nations – such as the US, which offers a capped US$7,500 (A$10,270) tax rebate on EV purchases – there are few incentives to encourage greater uptake of the cars themselves. Meanwhile, national transport emissions have risen 17% since 2005, the year against which the government’s international climate commitment is measured. Dr Jake Whitehead, from the University of Queensland’s Dow Centre for Sustainable Engineering Innovation, says Australia’s policy record on EVs is poor and risks falling further behind unless changes are made soon. Otherwise, he says, manufacturers will increasingly direct new models to countries with more advanced EV markets. He notes India – like Australia and the UK, a right-hand-side drive country – also has a 2030 target for ending the sale of new fossil fuel vehicles. “We have to recognise this transition is happening. It’s not a matter of if, it’s a matter of when,” Whitehead says. “A 2030 [ban] target would probably be impossible in Australia at this point, but at some point in the 2030s we will have to get there. Otherwise, we’re increasingly running the risk that we’ll be in a group of countries that will receive older technology that is less efficient and has lower safety standards because other markets will have moved on.” The Coalition government has made a series of promises to reduce emissions from the national car-fleet but, as a damning global climate transparency report pointed out last week, is yet to follow through. Back in 2015, the government said it would introduce vehicle emissions standards to cut emissions by 100m tonnes between 2020 and 2030. The inevitably of a shift in this direction was highlighted in a January 2018 opinion piece by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, who was then the minister for energy and the environment. He compared the rise of EVs to the iPhone and predicted people who mocked the technology would one day be using it. A ministerial forum advising the government on the issue proposed a vehicle emissions standard based on a US template that would have required light car emissions to be reduced to an average of 105 grams of CO2 per kilometre travelled – much less than what most of us currently drive. Evidence was presented to suggest it would add $13.9bn to the economy, but the idea was dropped following resistance within the Coalition and from the auto industry. By February 2019, the government was promising a national electric vehicle strategy. The ambition was relatively modest: it would reduce emissions by 2030 by up to 10m tonnes, less than 2% of the national total. Industry leaders were told to expect a discussion paper on the strategy in late 2019. A year on, nothing has been released. A recent Senate estimates hearing was told the plan for a standalone strategy had been dropped. EVs will instead be included in a $74.5m “future fuels” commitment that also takes in hydrogen and biofuels. A consultation paper is promised before the end of the year. Behyad Jafari, the chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Council, said departmental officials had worked on an EV strategy, but it had not been released by the minister for energy and emissions reduction, Angus Taylor. “It seems like the minister wasn’t really engaging with the plan, or his office wasn’t really responding to the department,” Jafari says. “It clearly wasn’t a priority.” Some in the industry believe the government backed itself into a corner in last year’s election campaign when Scott Morrison opportunistically accused then opposition leader Bill Shorten for wanting to “end the weekend” via a Labor promise of a non-binding target of 50% of new cars being electric by 2030. The auto-industry is disappointed the government ignored the findings of an inquiry led by former independent senator Tim Storer early last year, which suggested what a fully costed and budget-neutral EV policy might look like. It suggested a reduction in taxes, stamp duty and vehicle registration charges, and found federal car fleets could be turned 50% electric by 2025 for only $5m. Australia’s relatively few EV support programs vary between jurisdictions. The ACT is the most generous, offering zero interest loans of up to 15,000 for an EV purchase, stamp duty exemptions and two years of free registration. The ACT and Tasmania have both set a target of government car fleets going 100% electric. The latter is considered a vital step in creating a secondhand market, given these fleets are regularly turned over. Nationally, the Morrison government has issued grants and loans through its clean energy agencies, mostly for charging infrastructure. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency last week announced a $8.25m trial with energy company AGL using EVs as a battery plugged into the electricity grid – a model that experts believe could revolutionise energy storage. But EVs were not included among five low-emissions priority technologies announced by the government in September, despite Taylor suggesting in June they would be a focus. In response to questions from Guardian Australia, a spokesman for Taylor said the government believed in backing a range of technologies, “not picking one winner”. “Australians should be able to choose which type of car they drive and the Morrison government will support them in this decision,” he said. While the federal government says its approach to EVs will follow its “technology, not taxes” mantra on emissions reduction policy, some states are proposing new road user charges that will increase the cost of driving clean cars. Both the South Australian Liberal government and, following an announcement on Saturday, the Victorian Labor government plan to introduce a per kilometre tax on EVs from next year. The NSW government discussed a similar proposal but has rejected it for now. Jafari says if they go ahead these plans would make Australia the first place to make using the developing technology more expensive, rather than trying to bring down the price. “We would absolutely become a laughing stock for telling people not to buy electric vehicles,” he says. Trent Zimmerman, a moderate federal Liberal MP representing North Sydney, agrees now is not the time. “I think introducing road user charges for electric vehicles any time in this decade would be a mistake,” he says. Most analysts believe EVs will be equivalent in price to petrol or diesel models within five years, and likely cheaper once lower running and maintenance costs are factored in. Chinese manufacturer MG this month launched the lowest price EV on the Australian market – a $40,990 SUV crossover that is nearly $10,000 cheaper than its nearest rival, the Nissan Leaf. But Whitehead says there are already several examples of auto-makers ignoring Australia with new models in favour of more mature markets. For example, Korean manufacturer Kia dropped plans to introduce new EV models here, instead focusing on countries with more ambitious policy support. He says it is a sign of what lies ahead. “We need a clear target and a clear set of policies to get us there,” Whitehead says. “If Australia continues down this pathway of non-existent policy we will be left behind, and we’ll all suffer for that.”",12

Scott Morrison told the National Press Club earlier this month the government was “getting on with” reducing emissions, citing official data that found emissions were down 3% in the year to June to their lowest levels since 1998. He declared “these are the facts”. An audit by Hugh Saddler, an energy consultant and honorary associate professor at ANU’s Crawford school of public policy, suggests at least some of the drop is likely to disappear. The monthly national energy emissions audit, published by the Australia Institute, found there had been about a 4.5% fall in carbon pollution over the two years to 2020. This was mostly due to a surge in solar and wind electricity, but also linked to the impact of the Covid-19 shutdown, particularly on transport, and ongoing effects from the long-term drought, which significantly reduced sheep and cattle numbers. The audit found the cuts in the latter two categories were not likely to continue. The end of lockdowns and domestic travel restrictions meant emissions from road traffic and aviation were likely to “revert to their previous steadily growing trend”. Similarly, agriculture emissions were likely to rise as drought conditions eased and herd numbers and crop production increased, in line with government projections. Nearly 80% of agricultural emissions are from livestock and cropping. Saddler said it underlined that recent national emissions reductions had largely been the result of external circumstances, not climate policy. The Morrison government does not have overarching policies to reduce emissions from transport or agriculture. He said a recent government “future fuels” discussion paper on reducing emissions from transport offered “almost nothing”, and the government had no plan to cut agriculture emissions. Several Nationals MPs have argued the sector should be excluded from climate commitments, a stance that puts them at odds with farming groups calling for a 2050 net zero emissions target. “Electricity generation emissions will continue to fall but, in the absence of any significant policy changes, reductions from this sector will be offset by steadily increasing transport emissions,” Saddler said. “Total emissions from all sectors other than electricity generation will remain almost unchanged from 2018.” The audit is consistent with official emissions projections released in December, which estimated national carbon pollution would drop by less than 7% over the next decade under current policies. The projections report suggested the Morrison government was not yet on track to meet Australia’s 2030 emissions target under the Paris climate conference (a 26% to 28% cut to 2005 levels). Instead, established policies would lead to a 22% cut over that timeframe. More than half of that was achieved before the Coalition was elected in 2013. Morrison has said the government wants Australia to reach net zero emissions as soon as possible, and preferably by 2050, through a “technology, not taxes” approach, but has not explained how its policies would achieve that. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, said emissions from vehicles and farming were now almost equal to those from the entire electricity sector. “There is a real opportunity for the federal government to set the country on course to net zero emissions by 2050, if not sooner, but this requires sector-level plans for transport and agriculture,” he said. The audit looks at the change in emissions in the national electricity market, covering the five eastern states and the Australian Capital Territory, since 2008. They fell 26.5% over that time as coal-fired power plants closed and reduced their operating capacity, and wind and solar energy made up a greater share of the power supply. The spike in renewable energy investment was largely driven by the national renewable energy target – which was filled in 2019 and not extended or replaced – and aided by state targets and a rapid reduction in the cost of solar and wind energy technology. Renewable energy including rooftop solar now provides about 27% of annual electricity. Despite Covid-19 lockdowns, electricity use fell only 0.6% between February and November last year. But the amount of electricity generated by burning coal fell nearly 8% in both New South Wales and Queensland between late 2019 and late 2020. Saddler said the NSW Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act, which passed state parliament in November and promises to underwrite 12 gigawatts of new solar and wind and 2GW of long-duration storage, would be a significant development in managing the shift to variable renewable energy.",6

A path to net zero emissions is technically and economically feasible for Australia, the report says, and would align the country with the Paris climate agreement it signed in 2016. Such a transition would create tens of thousands of new jobs in the renewable energy industry and “future-proof” the country from economic shocks as the rest of the world moved away from fossil fuels. The report, from Climate Action Tracker (CAT), used two different models covering climate policies and energy systems to find out how the country could reach net zero emissions by 2050. Many of Australia’s key trading partners, including those currently purchasing most of the country’s coal and LNG exports, have endorsed a net zero target by 2050, including Japan and South Korea. China, the world’s biggest emitter, has said it will balance its emissions to zero by 2060. US president-elect Joe Biden has made cutting emissions a key priority for his administration, saying the country will reach net zero by 2050 with 100% renewable electricity by 2030. Reaching net zero means that a country’s greenhouse gas emissions from activities such as fossil fuel burning and mining are balanced by the uptake of carbon in soils, forests or by technologies like carbon capture and storage. The Morrison government has refused to budge on its current targets and has said only that it will aim to reach net zero by the second half of this century, a position some experts say is at odds with the Paris agreement. A lead author on the CAT report, Ursula Fuentes Hutfilter, a senior climate policy adviser at Climate Analytics, told Guardian Australia: “The biggest missing piece [for Australia] is to have a consistent approach across the economy. “That means setting a net zero target for 2050 and then working backwards to see how fast each sector needs to transition. “Once you have a 2050 target and you look at how you get there, what you then see is that you have to then enhance the 2030 target.” Australia’s 2030 target to cut emissions by 26%-28% from 2005 levels has remained the same since it was first announced by the Abbott government in 2015. The CAT report says Australia’s 2030 target should be raised to 66% below 2005 levels, which is at the high end of the range recommended in 2014 by the government’s Climate Change Authority. Fuentes Hutfilter said: “So many of the policies that have proven to be effective in similar places are not in place in Australia, but if they were it could escalate the transition. It is hard to find a country where the policy gap is so large.” She said policies such as a national renewable energy target, emissions standards in the transport sector, support for electric vehicles and energy efficiency incentives in industry were all policy levers being pulled by other developed countries that were absent in Australia. In the electricity sector, coal was the dirtiest power source and would need to be phased out by 2030. The CAT modelling also shows that gas, which currently delivers about 20% of Australia’s electricity, would drop to about 3% by 2030 and be gone by 2040. The Morrison government has flagged a gas-fired recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, saying the fossil fuel compliments renewables by “keeping the lights on when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing”. But the CAT report says technologies including battery storage and pumped hydro, as well as better management of electricity demand, would mean gas-fired electricity would not be needed. Fuentes Hutfilter said: “Renewable energy technologies are the cheapest, and that’s why the modelling shows [gas phasing out]. “Storage technologies are developing with costs falling fast, so all the technologies needed are already in place. There’s no need to add gas. “We know coal will be declining anyway because Australia has an old coal fleet that’s becoming increasingly unreliable.” She said Australia’s potential to generate energy from renewable sources was “immense” and the country could export that renewable energy embedded in products, including green hydrogen. An essential component to reach net zero, the CAT report finds, is to end deforestation by the year 2030. Stopping deforestation and allowing trees and soils to take up more carbon would reduce reliance on other technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, to balance the country’s carbon budget. Allowing deforestation to continue and relying instead on CCS did not have the co-benefit of delivering benefits for biodiversity, the report said. One of the most challenging industries to decarbonise would be Australia’s export-focused LNG sector, and carbon capture and storage may be needed there to meet a net zero target. Australia’s current policies were failing to deliver sufficient greenhouse gas reductions across the transports and industry sectors and were only just getting started in electricity generation. The report found current policies would create 25,600 direct jobs in power generation, but shifting to policies in line with the Paris goals that emphasised local manufacturing would deliver 62,300 direct jobs.",7
australia-news/2020/sep/09/agl-bets-on-electric-vehicles-subscription-service-to-boost-australias-uptake,Environment,australia-news/2020/sep/09/agl-bets-on-electric-vehicles-subscription-service-to-boost-australias-uptake,"Energy company will provide car, charging station as well as insurance and registration for flat fee, as research points to upfront cost as deterrent ","AGL, one of Australia’s largest energy companies, has launched the country’s first subscription service for electric cars in a move that the EV industry hopes may boost the nation’s low uptake rate. The company announced a pilot phase for the new scheme, which also includes installation of charging stations at customers’ homes, to cover Sydney and Melbourne. The industry group the Electric Vehicle Council, which last month announced sales of electric vehicles had tripled between 2018 and 2019, said AGL’s move was a glimpse into the future of the electric vehicle market. AGL said it hoped the subscription service, available only to its own customers, would remove the barriers for people to drive electric cars – namely, the high upfront costs and the desire for a charging station at home. Under the service, subscribers pay an $800 set-up fee and then a weekly price for a car starting at $299 that includes the installation of a charging station as well as insurance, maintenance and registration. The AGL executive John Chambers told Guardian Australia the company was looking ahead at the rapid growth of electric vehicles and the role the vehicle’s batteries could play to store energy at homes as well as power vehicles. “That is a frontier for us,” he said. The car batteries were typically six or seven times the size of the residential batteries people installed to store their solar power. Several models of car will be available under the service, AGL said, including Nissan, Tesla, Jaguar and Hyundai. Customers would not be locked into a contract. AGL said the electricity used to charge the batteries would be carbon-neutral through offsets purchased under a government-accredited scheme. Last month AGL announced all its 400 corporate vehicles would be electric by 2030. The company is Australia’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases and has a target to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. In June the company announced it would be linking manager bonuses to its climate targets. The Melbourne-based company JET Charge will install the charging stations for AGL’s subscription scheme. JET Charge’s chief executive, Tim Washington, said the stations can recharge a car battery three times faster than a standard socket and complete a full recharge overnight. “The greatest way to get someone to purchase an electric vehicle is to just get them to try it,” he told Guardian Australia. “So this is a fantastic way for people to be able to try before they buy.” He said energy utility companies in other countries had also set up electric vehicle subscription services and AGL’s move was an example of how the energy market would converge around electric vehicles. He said energy companies were increasingly seeing electric vehicles as a way to store energy that could be fed back into the electricity grid. Washington said JET Charge had grown from employing one electrician in 2014 to a business with 40 staff and 150 contractors that had installed 4,500 charging stations. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, he said, the company was installing about 20 electric charging stations a day. Behyad Jafari, the chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Council that represents major car brands and infrastructure companies including JET Charge, told Guardian Australia that upfront costs were a major barrier to people driving electric vehicles. “This is going to make electric vehicles available to more consumers,” he said of AGL’s plan. “More than half of all consumers say they want to buy an electric vehicle but the high upfront price gets in the way.” He said the subscription service for electric vehicles “hints at what the future of this market looks like”, with car sharing and ride sharing schemes also focusing on electric cars. Even though electric vehicles sales tripled in Australia from 2018 to 2019, the 6,718 sold in 2019 only represents 0.6% of new car sales. Jafari said 3,226 electric vehicles had been sold in 2020 up to the end of June. Sales in 2020 may not grow from 2019, he said, but he expected they would be steady when sales of non-electric vehicles were falling.",3

After more than a decade of obstruction and doing the least possible, the rest of the world is changing fast and the debate in Australia needs to get real. As Katharine Murphy put it so well on Tuesday, the government has no real climate change policy to speak of, but they do have a hell of a lot of fighting over pretending that there is. Which is more abysmal – the farcical electric vehicles discussion paper that does not seek to reduce emissions, or the deputy prime minister suggesting agriculture be “carved out” from any net zero target that does not actually exist? It is all a symptom of treating climate change as an issue that should be put off until later. To be honest, even the ALP is susceptible to this when it remains unwilling to commit to cutting emissions by 2030, out of a (probably correct) belief that any such target will be politically damaging. As I noted last week, pushing things off till later will not only require more drastic cuts, but that we will also quickly reach points where any cuts will not be enough to prevent temperatures from rising above either 1.5C or 2C above pre-industrial levels. And with the EU now exploring a carbon border tax, all those years of refusing to act and obstructing action to notionally protect our economy are about to cause a massive economic shock. Reducing that shock is going to need more than just suggesting we need to switch to wind and solar electric power. In late 2019, I suggested that politicians needed to start being honest about the difficulty of reducing emissions. I got some criticism from people within the ALP that such an approach is a good way to lose elections. And perhaps that is correct. But I am rather unwilling to support something inadequate merely because it is slightly less so than that proposed by the Coalition. Inadequate policy is not what is needed even in the best of times, and climate change right now is fast becoming the worst of times. The cost of climate change clearly and vastly outweighs the costs of reducing emissions, but that doesn’t mean doing so is easy. Alas the debate remains still one where politicians would have us believe we can achieve net zero by just doing the easy things – or that some sectors can be excused. The problem is all we have done thus far are the trouble-free things and have excused far too many. Consider that if Scott Morrison came out today and said from 2023 onwards (to give the sector a bit of time to prepare) we will target zero electricity emissions by 2045. That would be excellent, but even though electricity is our biggest generator of emissions, reducing only that to zero would still have Australia emitting 388Gt C02 in 2045: Graph not displaying? Click here The problem is that while electricity accounts for a third of all emissions, that still leaves two-thirds: Graph not displaying? Click here Over the past decade, most focus at policy level has been on reducing electricity emissions, and as a result, emissions from other sectors have remained mostly flat or growing: Graph not displaying? Click here The latest government projections have only electricity emissions falling by 2030, while the stationary energy, transport and agriculture sectors will increase emissions. The transport, agriculture and stationary energy (which is, for example, the emissions produced in manufacturing and construction) sectors are expected to grow from a combined 263Gt C02 in 2020 to 277Gt C02 in 2030 – a 5% increase in the next decade and some 13% above the 2005 levels. In reality, they should be at least 50% below 2005 levels by then. And this is what I mean by getting honest with people. No one notices where your electricity comes from when you switch on a light, but people will notice having to change the way they drive or commute; businesses will notice having to think about the transport of goods via trucks, what they emit when they manufacture products that we all will still want, and farmers will certainly notice having to change what they farm and how they do it. But the changes need to occur across all sectors – not least of because, as Peter Mailler pointed out, the agriculture industry will be the most directly affected by climate change (a fact only the National party seems unaware of) – but also because the longer we wait and the more exemptions we provide the harder the transition will be. If we aim to stay within the carbon budget that limits temperature rises to 2C above pre-industrial levels, our current path means after 2030 we would need to cut the equivalent of 17% of our current emissions each year – something we haven’t been able to do in the 15 years since 2005: Graph not displaying? Click here Right now climate policy is a mix of delusion and denial – a hope that low-hanging fruit is all that needs to be picked, and that we can put off everything else till later. That needs to end now. Our economy and emissions are more than just electricity – and political parties that care about people’s lives should be doing all they can to help us all make the changes that need to be done.",-1

On Tuesday, Chris Bowen asked Scott Morrison about the IPCC report and, if he was in favour of “more technology” to combat climate change, “why did the prime minister claim that electric vehicles would end the weekend?” Morrison fobbed the question off to Angus Taylor but not before replying “the claim made by the questioner is false”. Well now. It took those listening less time than it took Taylor to get to the dispatch box to produce evidence that the claim made by the questioner was true. In April 2019, Morrison told reporters that, “Bill Shorten wants to end the weekend when it comes to his policy on electric vehicles, where you’ve got Australians who love being out there in their four-wheel-drives.” Now maybe he could wriggle out by saying he didn’t say electrical vehicles would end the weekend but Shorten’s policy on electrical vehicles would – this was Morrison’s own explanation made after question time. But are we so base that we should hold the prime minister of Australia to such a pathetic standard? Because Morrison did specifically link electrical vehicles to weekend destruction. He said (and you can watch the video just to check) that “the cheapest car you can currently buy, as an electric vehicle … is about $45,000 to $50,000. That’s the cheapest car Bill Shorten wants to make available to you to buy in the future, and I’ll tell you what, it’s not going to tow your trailer. It’s not going to tow your boat. It’s not going to get you out to your favourite camping spot with your family”. That claim was incorrect. Electric vehicles in 2019 could already tow your boat or trailer, and the ALP’s policy related to cars in 2030, by which time I think we can say the technology will have advanced. But of course, not only was he wrong about the power of electric vehicles, he was also wrong about the policy – which was that by 2030 the ALP aimed for half of new car sales to be electric vehicles, not that you would not be able to buy or own a combustion engine SUV. It was a mistake about a policy that involved a mistake about electric vehicles and this week, to complete the trifecta, he tried to pretend he didn’t mean what we all heard him say. Not surprisingly this was about climate change – a topic where truth and reality departed the Coalition party room decades ago. It fits perfectly with his claims that Australia will make our Paris target emissions cuts of 26% “in a canter” despite all evidence to the contrary. But while misleading the public is bad (if, alas, taken as a given now), worse is that this claim ignores the fact that a 26% cut remains inadequate. The IPCC report this week outlined two scenarios for reducing emissions that have a chance of preventing temperatures from rising by more than 2C above pre-industrial averages. To remain below a 2C rise we need to cut 2020 emissions by 13% by 2030, and to prevent temperatures rising by more than 1.5C we need a 43% cut. Click here if you cannot view the graph Australia’s current target of a 26% cut from 2005 levels translates to just an 11% cut over the next decade. That’s bad enough; the real problem is we’re only on target to cut them by 7%. We are failing to do even the inadequate. But how can we expect otherwise? We have a government led by a man not only unwilling to face up to the reality of what needs to be done, but who cannot even be honest about his own statements that were made precisely to undermine efforts to do what needs to be done. To combat climate change, you first need to be honest about the issue with the public. Scott Morrison has utterly failed in this regard.",0
environment/2021/aug/12/clean-fuel-blue-hydrogen-coal-study,Environment,environment/2021/aug/12/clean-fuel-blue-hydrogen-coal-study,Infrastructure bill includes $8bn to develop ‘clean hydrogen’ but study finds large emissions from production of ‘blue’ hydrogen,"The large infrastructure bill passed by the US Senate and hailed by Joe Biden as a key tool to tackle the climate crisis includes billions of dollars to support a supposedly clean fuel that is potentially even more polluting than coal, new research has found. The $1tn infrastructure package, which passed with bipartisan support on Tuesday, includes $8bn to develop “clean hydrogen” via the creation of four new regional hubs. The White House has said the bill advances Biden’s climate agenda and proponents of hydrogen have touted it as a low-emissions alternative to fuel shipping, trucking, aviation and even home heating. But a new study has found surprisingly large emissions from the production of so-called “blue” hydrogen, a variant being enthusiastically pushed by the fossil fuel industry and probably falling under the definition of clean hydrogen in the Senate bill. Blue hydrogen involves splitting gas into hydrogen and carbon dioxide and then capturing and storing the CO2 to ensure it doesn’t heat the planet. But this process involves the incidental release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and uses a huge amount of energy to separate and then store the carbon dioxide, some of which escapes anyway. This means that the production of this hydrogen actually creates 20% more greenhouse gases than coal, commonly regarded the most polluting fossil fuel, when being burned for heat, and 60% more than burning diesel, according to the new paper, published in the Energy Science & Engineering journal. “It’s pretty striking, I was surprised at the results,” said Robert Howarth, a scientist at Cornell University who authored the paper alongside Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University researcher. “Blue hydrogen is a nice marketing term that the oil and gas industry is keen to push but it’s far from carbon free. I don’t think we should be spending our funds this way, on these sort of false solutions.” The Hydrogen Council, a group that includes the oil companies BP, Total and Shell among its members, has said that hydrogen has a “key role to play in the global energy transition” by replacing more polluting fuels, predicting it will account for 18% of total energy demand by 2050. Dozens of gas companies in the US have started producing hydrogen or testing its viability in existing gas pipelines, which some climate campaigners have said is a step towards entrenching fossil fuel infrastructure at a time when the world, as outlined by Monday’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, needs to rapidly move to net-zero emissions. But others are more upbeat about the use of hydrogen to help lower emissions in some stubbornly polluting sectors. “Hydrogen is not a panacea or a silver bullet, but it appears to be critical for decarbonization of ‘hard-to-electrify’ sectors such as long-haul heavy trucking, international marine shipping and some parts of heavy industry,” said Mike Fowler, director of advanced energy technology research at the Clean Air Task Force. There is a form of “green” hydrogen that involves producing hydrogen from water using only renewable energy, but this option isn’t explicitly chosen for funding by the infrastructure bill, which still needs to pass the Democrat-held House of Representatives. “We look at that bill and see massive giveaways to fossil fuel infrastructure that is incompatible with serious climate action,” said Carroll Muffett, chief executive of the Center for International Environmental Law. “Congress went out of its way to not specify green hydrogen and so this funding just helps prop up the fossil fuel industry. The potential of these technologies is being routinely overstated even as the impacts are being understated.” The latest IPCC report, which warned of “irreversible” impacts if emissions aren’t drastically cut, identified methane, produced from oil and gas drilling and animal agriculture, as providing a huge contribution to current global heating. If methane, a short-lived but very powerful greenhouse gas, was cut by around half this decade, it would shave 0.3C off the increase in global temperature by 2040. Progressive Democrats hope that methane, as well as other greenhouse gases, will be more comprehensively tackled in an upcoming $3.5tn reconciliation bill that will include far stronger climate measures than the infrastructure legislation. “This budget resolution will be a generational investment in the future of our people and our planet,” said Ed Markey, a Democratic senator who helped craft the Green New Deal alongside Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.",11

The 64-year-old said the pollution is badly affecting the health of the population, which has already been hit hard by Covid. “More people are having breathing problems and asthma problems than ever before,” David said. She started suffering from asthma for the first time two years ago and other people in Hamlet have been getting nosebleeds, which she also puts down to the dust. “The older people have it the worst,” she added. “They stay inside most of the time and when they do come out they struggle to breathe. They can’t sit out in their yards like they used to.” The plant, owned by Maryland-headquartered Enviva, the world’s largest biomass producer, is one of four the company operates in North Carolina, turning trees into wood pellets, most of which are exported to the UK, Europe and Japan to burn for energy. Biomass has been promoted as a carbon-neutral energy source by industry, some countries and lawmakers on the basis that the emissions released by burning wood can be offset by the carbon dioxide taken up by trees grown to replace those burned. Yet there remain serious doubts among many scientists about its carbon-neutral credentials, especially when wood pellets are made by cutting down whole trees, rather than using waste wood products. It can take as much as a century for trees to grow enough to offset the carbon released. Burning wood for energy is also inefficient – biomass has been found to release more carbon dioxide per unit of energy than coal or gas, according to a 2018 study and an open letter to the EU signed by nearly 800 scientists. This CO2 is theoretically reabsorbed by new trees, but some scientists suggest relying on biomass could actually end up increasing emissions just at the time when the world needs to sharply reduce emissions and reach goals of becoming net zero by 2050. “During these decades, warming increases and permafrost and glaciers continue to melt, among other permanent forms of climate damage,” said Tim Searchinger, a senior energy and environment research scholar at Princeton. Over the last decade a wave of biomass plants have opened their doors or ramped up production across the US south, where they have access to the region’s vast hardwood and other wetland forests, many of which are on unprotected private lands. Campaigners say there is an environmental justice aspect to the industry, too. The plants are 50% more likely to be located in counties where at least 25% of the population is Black and other people of color and where poverty levels are above the state median, according to an analysis by the environmental non-profit Dogwood Alliance. Hamlet, David’s neighborhood, has a poverty rate of nearly 29%, significantly above the state poverty rate of 13.6%. Still, the biomass industry continues to grow, supported by subsidies especially from the UK as well as the EU, which declared biomass a carbon-neutral energy source in 2009 and is relying on it to help the bloc replace fossil fuel energy and meet climate goals. At least 22 plants in the south-east are now exporting pellets to Europe, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC). This number is increasing, with permits filed or issued for 12 more plants, according to the SELC. Nearly 200 miles from Hamlet, Belinda Joyner, a retired resident of Garysburg, North Carolina, has been campaigning against the nearby Northampton county Enviva plant since it began operations in 2013. The 68-year-old said she was angry at what she feels is happening to her community. She is concerned about forest loss as well as air pollution from the biomass facilities which, according a report from the Environmental Integrity Project, have been found to emit hazardous pollutants such as airborne particles called PM2.5 and volatile organic compounds, linked to health and environmental problems. “The trees are gone and there’s a lot of particulates in the air,” Joyner said. “We need oxygen and we need trees to breathe.” Joyner said residents’ sleep was disturbed by the “unbearable” noise produced by the pellet plant’s 24/7 operations. Many people have lived here all their lives, she said, and they “shouldn’t have to put up with the noise, dust and the pollution”. Enviva said any suggestion of unbearable noise, traffic or pollution caused by its facilities was a “gross misrepresentation” of its operations. The company said its emissions did not present a public health risk and the health conditions alleged by residents “are not related to our operations and any claims that they are, are false”. All sites operate in strict compliance with laws and regulation and emissions levels are regularly tested, Enviva said. The company uses industry-proven air emissions control technology​​, a spokesperson said, adding: “Our plants are the most environmentally controlled plants in the industry, if not the world.” Enviva said it had not received any complaints about dust from its North Carolina plants and pointed to the presence of other industrial facilities in Northampton and Hamlet, saying: “Noise and traffic impact of a combined industry presence in the area is sometimes used against us by groups who oppose the biomass industry.” The company said it chose the location of its plants based on factors including proximity to low-grade wood, transport and an accessible workforce, adding that the industry “propels economic development in rural areas”. Enviva also referred to its community work, telling the Guardian “we work hard to be both a good neighbor and a good employer”. It pointed to an award it received from the Northampton county chamber of commerce in June for community outreach. Toby Chappell, county manager for Greenwood county, South Carolina, where Enviva has another plant, said the company had had “a positive economic impact”, employing more than 100 people and creating a secondary market for timber owners who can sell “some of their less desirable wood products”. At an August 2020 virtual public hearing on the company’s plan to install pollution control equipment and increase production at its Greenwood county plant several people, especially those involved in the forestry industry, spoke in favor of the plant. James Sanders Jr, of the Greenwood County Forest Landowners Association, told the hearing: “Markets for forest products such as those provided by Enviva will help slow the conversion of South Carolina’s forest to more intensive land use.” But several residents living near the plant said the factory had harmed their health and quality of life. One resident, Annemarie Humm, speaking on behalf of a group of residents opposing the plant’s expansion, said: “We feel trapped. We urge you to keep our air clean, our nights quiet, so we and our children can sleep.” For the biomass industry, burning wood for energy will play a vital role in transforming the energy system. Sustainably sourced biomass is “one of the important tools available to mitigate the climate crisis”, said Jennifer Jenkins, Enviva’s chief sustainability officer, adding it provided “low-carbon” power “with the potential to generate negative emissions”. Some scientists have also pointed to carbon and forestry benefits of burning wood for energy, where forests are managed sustainably and harvested using good forestry practices. Puneet Dwivedi, associate professor at the University of Georgia, has argued that looking at biomass on a landscape-level – a whole forest rather than an individual tree or clump of trees – means the carbon emitted by burning one tree will be recaptured within a year as the forest grows. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said biomass can mitigate emissions, provided resources are developed sustainably and especially when wood residues and waste are used. However, environmental groups have suggested that forests are not necessarily being managed sustainably. Many people assume that wood pellets for biomass are made from waste wood, offcuts and residues, said the SELC attorney Heather Hillaker, but that is not always the case. “Anything that is not profitable to go to a sawmill, [biomass producers] consider waste,” she said, adding that this includes whole trees deemed to have no economic value to the forestry industry. A 2018 investigation by the current affairs program Dispatches on Britain’s Channel 4 claimed that mature trees were being felled in Virginia to feed Enviva wood pellet plants. Enviva said the program’s claims were “illegitimate” and that the trees were not high value or whole trees. Jenkins said all of Enviva’s wood was “low-value”, meaning limbs, tops or trees that would otherwise go unused. The company only sourced “fiber from the bottom of the harvest value scale”, she said, and had “strict sourcing guidelines that hold us to the highest standards of sustainability”. A spokesperson for Enviva said: “We categorically do not support biomass production in the US or abroad that threatens endangered species, harms biodiversity, or diminishes water quality.” As the international community hammers out how to decarbonize energy and stave off catastrophic climate change, debates about biomass’s role are growing louder. In February 2021, an open letter from more than 500 scientists called on Joe Biden, along with other world leaders, to end the subsidies for biomass so as not to “undermine both climate goals and the world’s biodiversity” by replacing burning fossil fuels with burning trees. In July the EU amended its Renewable Energy Directive, saying it would continue to use biomass but “tighten the sustainability criteria”, including prohibiting the use of biomass from primary and highly biodiverse forests. But biomass is still considered an important part of the renewable energy mix in the UK and the EU – bioenergy made up 60% of the bloc’s renewables in 2020. These countries are moving in “the wrong direction”, said Sasha Stashwick, a senior advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “This is not good for climate change. This is not good for the environment. This is not good for forests and this is not good for the local communities,” she said. In Garysburg, Joyner is calling on global policymakers and industry bosses to acknowledge the problems with biomass. She said the voices of those who live near wood pellet plants are “still going unheard” as the biomass industry continues to grow. “Profit over people – that’s how I see it,” Joyner said. “As long as they’re making that money, they don’t care how people feel and they don’t care what’s going on in your community.”",2

Around 78m new cars are sold every year. To head off the worst effects of climate change, every single one will need to go electric eventually. Whether it rolls off a production line in Fremont, California, or comes together in a vast megafactory in Qinghai, China, a colossal amount of human effort must go into building the components and obtaining their base minerals. In each car, for instance, there is roughly a kilogram of magnet providing the motion needed to fire engines and electrify windows. Roughly 30% of this material is made up of rare earth material known as neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr). This material is three times stronger and a tenth the size of conventional magnets – and essential to the process. In 2016, Japanese car manufacturer Honda tried and failed to build a hybrid vehicle without rare earths. Over the next decade the use of NdPr in electric vehicle magnets alone is projected to soak up 40% of total demand, according to some projections. Numbers that big are hard to ignore and though Australia may have dragged its feet on climate change over the past two decades, the prospect of making a killing in the electric vehicle supply chain is getting attention – especially as the rare earths business is dominated by China. Rare earths are a clutch of 15 minerals from the lanthanide series of the periodic table, though this number is extended to include scandium and yttrium. These are minerals that occur in low concentrations and in geological formations that can make extracting them costly. The science can be complicated, says Allison Britt, Geoscience Australia’s director of minerals advice, but speaking in very general terms it is because they oxidise quickly and the process can be extremely polluting. “In a nutshell, rare earths are so chemically similar, they’re really, really tricky to separate,” says Allison Britt. “And in addition, some of the minerals they occur as can contain radioactive elements like uranium and thorium.” A rare earth like neodymium begins life as a mineral encased in another mineral. Once pulled from the ground, the rock has to be crushed and cracked – a process that involves heating the material to break the chemical bonds that bind it together. After that comes “leaching”, where a chemical wash is used to dissolve the rare earth so it can then be gathered up as a concentrate. From there is refined into a pure oxide ready for manufacture. According to the US Geological Survey, Australia contributed 17,000 tons of rare earths to the global supply last year. That is nothing compared to the world’s largest supplier, China, which produced a whopping 140,000 tons of rare earths – not counting the volume added by the off-the-books trade. Alone, China accounts for 58% of the world’s supply and the majority of the world’s refining capacity, thanks to its control of the intellectual property around the process and ability to run these industrial operations cheap and dirty. The only other refinery outside of mainland China is found in Malaysia and is operated by the Australian company Lynas Rare Earths. John Coyne from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says none of this happened by accident. “I don’t think you get this sort of dominance of the market when you aren’t well endowed with those rare earths, I think it was a natural extension of their economic miracle,” Coyne says. “Someone in China saw that opportunity early on and now they dominate the market.” In May 2015, the Chinese government released its 10-year industrial development plan titled Made in China 2025. While the country already had the capacity to make wind turbines, photovoltaic solar cells and electric vehicles in huge enough quantities to make them cheap, the ambition was to turn a low-tech industrial base into a high-tech manufacturing sector. Doing so, however, called for Chinese companies to ensure 70% of the components and materials they used were sourced domestically by 2050. This portion of the document was enough to spook governments in Europe and North America – particularly as China had shown a willingness to weaponise supply chains it controlled during moments of heightened tension. During a dispute with Japan over the Senkaku Islands in 2010, China slashed is global export of rare earths by 37%. The prospect of a supply shortage in an economy built around its electronics sector prompted the Japanese government to find alternative sources. A similar incident occurred in 2019 when former US president Donald Trump launched an ill-advised trade war against China. In response, Chinese president Xi Jinping took a highly publicised tour of a rare earth production facility while state-controlled media The People’s Daily floated the possibility of retaliation. “Will rare earths become a counter weapon for China to hit back against the pressure the United States has put on for no reason at all?” the paper asked. “The answer is no mystery.” Roughly two years and a pandemic on, it is tempting to view the situation in the context of rising geopolitical tensions with China. Christian Downie, an associate professor in the school of regulation and global governance at the Australian National University, says to allow this to continue further would be a mistake as it would only work to undermine any global transition to a zero carbon economy. “With the growing strategic competition between the US and China, the risk is that supply chains that are essential for the rapid deployment of clean energy technology could be disrupted by these political rivalries,” Downie says. “You’d have to say that the way the critical minerals debate is being framed and the way countries are positioning themselves, suggests we’re moving down that pathway.” Responding to trade tensions and worries about security of supply, companies such as Apple have already announced a next generation iPhone that will rely on recycled rare earth. Meanwhile, governments are talking tough. In March, a teleconference between the US, Japan, Australia and India held as part of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue – a strategic partnership originally formed to counterbalance the influence of China in the Asia-Pacific – focused on the urgent need to find alternative sources of rare earths and build more refining capacity. Since then there has been a flurry of activity as the Australian government has positioned itself to meet the new demand. A Critical Minerals Strategy had already been released in 2019, but rare earths received special mention under prime minister Scott Morrison’s $1.5bn National Manufacturing Priority roadmap in September last year. Under the plan, rare earth projects could access dual financial support from Export Finance Australia and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund. Elsewhere, Australian companies have been jostling for new business. While the Malaysian government has moved to close Lynas Resource’s refining plant after sustained pressure over the environmental impacts from pollution, the company has proposed shifting production to Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. It has also inked a deal to build a new refinery in Texas funded by the Pentagon. Other companies are also planning their own rare earth projects. Arafura Resources in particular is looking to break ground on its long-running Nolans rare earth project 135km north of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. Managing director Gavin Lockyer says it has taken 10 years to develop plans for the deposit, with its large concentrations of neodymium and praseodymium. The vision is for an all-in-one operation where all remediation work takes place progressively over the mine’s projected 33-year-lifespan instead of leaving it all to the end. “What makes us different is that we’re doing it all at the point of extraction, and we’re dealing with all our waste at the point of extraction. We’re just basically putting it back where it came from. We’re not transporting it around, or sending it to another country,” Lockyer says. “This is seen as very favourable, particularly among European companies that want traceability in their supply chains.” The end product will be an NdPr oxide that is 99.99% pure and has the consistency of talcum powder. The only thing standing in the way currently is finance. Lockyer says with prospective customers not willing to officially sign on the dotted line for fear of retaliation by their current Chinese-based suppliers, and the government-backed financial support previously offered yet to flow through, the clock is ticking. “Australia’s got an opportunity here not just to dig it up and ship it overseas. We could become a world leader in this area. We’ve got good quality deposits and we’ve got good know-how,” Lockyer says. “But we don’t have forever.”",4

But the amount of electricity being generated from renewable sources such as solar and wind continues to break records, with October seeing almost one-third of electricity being generated by clean sources. Energy data analysed for the Australia Institute’s regular National Energy Emissions Audit shows the pandemic’s main effect on emissions was in the transport sector as people travelled less and stayed at home. Lockdowns saw emissions from road transport plummet in the early part of 2020 but then start to rise sharply again towards September to almost reaching parity with previous years. One exception was Victoria, where emissions from transport fell again in line with the state’s second-wave lockdowns as Covid-19 cases peaked in August. In the year to June 2020, the audit suggests the drop in the use of petrol and diesel mainly for road transport, together with a decline in aviation fuel, saw a reduction of about 5.4mt of CO2e compared to an average year. Victoria saw the biggest drop in road transport emissions of 2.4mt from April to September 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. The analysis is produced for the institute by energy expert Hugh Saddler from Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, told Guardian Australia the government had supported the fossil fuel industry during the pandemic with subsidies for refineries. “There seems to be no shortage of support for the existing fossil fuel industry in transport,” Merzian said. “But when it comes to reducing demand for fossil fuels the government is nowhere.” In October, the federal energy minister, Angus Taylor, announced the government was investing $2oom to build new diesel storage and would pay Australian refineries one cent for each litre of petrol, diesel or jet fuel produced. Both Victoria and South Australia have announced plans for a new tax on electric vehicles, which experts have warned will discourage their uptake in a country already lagging the world on electric cars. Electric car sales are increasing in Australia but were just 0.6% of new car sales in 2019 compared to other developed countries where sales are between 2.5% and 5%. The Morrison government has been working on a strategy that morphed from one expected to focus on electric vehicles to a “future fuels strategy”. A draft of the plan leaked earlier this month was attacked by the electric vehicles industry which said the government had spent 18 months coming up with a “nothing” strategy. Britain has announced a ban on sales of new fossil fuel cars from 2030 with Japan to follow in 2035. Norway has set a 2025 deadline. “Australia remains highly reliant on fossil fuels for transport,” said Merzian. “The only real policy it has [to reduce emissions] is a pandemic. The lesson learned here is that we have to lower the demand for fossil fuels, not just secure supply which seems to be the focus for the energy minister.” A fall in the use of coal and gas to generate electricity up to October 2020 coincided with an increased share from renewable energy, the audit finds. Through October renewables were responsible for a record high 31.5% of electricity generation across Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia – the five states that form the National Electricity Market. On 2 October, renewables supplied a record-high 38.3% of electricity in the national market and the following day saw a 30-minute period where renewables supplied 53.8% of electricity – another record. Merzian said as the electricity network became less polluting there was a stronger argument to increase the numbers of electric vehicles on roads – many of which would be charged from the grid.",2
environment/2021/aug/19/ithaca-new-york-raised-100m-climate-proof-buildings,Environment,environment/2021/aug/19/ithaca-new-york-raised-100m-climate-proof-buildings,Ithaca has turned to private investors to help it decarbonize thousands of residential and commercial buildings,"When Fred Schoeps bought a 150-year-old building in downtown Ithaca, New York, a decade ago, he was one of only a handful of building owners dedicated to ending their reliance on fossil fuels and reducing their carbon footprint. His three-year renovation of the building, comprising three apartments above a skate store, included installing energy-efficient windows and insulation, plus fully electric appliances, heating and cooling systems. But while that was an achievement on its own, said Schoeps, Ithaca can not address climate change one building at a time. “In order to move the needle, you’ve got to think in terms of a thousand [buildings],” he said. Luis Aguirre-Torres, Ithaca’s new director of sustainability, is trying to do exactly that. The upstate New York city of 30,000, home to Cornell University and Ithaca College, adopted a Green New Deal in 2019, a big part of which involves decarbonizing thousands of privately owned commercial and residential buildings across the city. Ithaca’s main climate objective is to eliminate or offset all of its carbon emissions ​​by 2030. The focus on retrofitting buildings – installing electric heating systems, solar panels and battery storage as well as reducing energy use and greening the electric grid – promises to tackle an often-overlooked but significant contributor to climate change: buildings make up nearly 40% of US carbon emissions. Building owners won’t make the transition from fossil-fuel energy all by themselves, said Aguirre-Torres, and state-funded incentive programs are often complex and sluggish. So Ithaca is exploring a new solution to fund and motivate building owners to decarbonize: private equity. Aguirre-Torres has helped Ithaca – which has a total budget of less than $80m – raise $100m by offering investors entry to a large-scale program he pitched as low risk with the potential for lots of cashflow. The goal is to create a lending program providing low- or no-interest loans and quick implementation of sustainable technology. The first batch of building owners could sign up as soon as September. For most homeowners, the program would help them swap out a gas furnace for an electric heat pump, or a gas stove for an electric one – changes that would otherwise involve high upfront costs. Aguirre-Torres says the program will also train a new green workforce in Ithaca. “We’re talking about a people-first approach, rather than just purely environmental,” Aguirre-Torres said. The plan aims to create 1,000 new jobs by 2030, and the city has promised to redirect 50% of the financial benefits of its Green New Deal plan to low-income residents, although there are few specifics on how this will work. Conversations with investors started earlier this year. Covid-19 had already battered Ithaca’s finances, said Aguirre-Torres, and it was clear the city would never be able to fund this energy transformation alone. These discussions quickly revealed a problem: how do you keep a lending program affordable? “What we needed to do was bring down the cost of capital even further,” Aguirre-Torres said. The city is addressing this by trying to reduce risk. It aims to create an economy of scale by sizing the program for 1,000 commercial and residential buildings in the first 1,000 days, which will mean more consistent work for contractors and lower material costs. Ithaca plans to use a $10m loan loss reserve, backed by New York state, that would act as a guarantee for lenders in case any borrower defaults. It will also secure insurance to protect against “catastrophic losses”, such as a massive default due to another pandemic, Aguirre-Torres said. Taken together, this means that money will be offered to building owners as low- or no-interest loans paid back by utility bill savings, and could even come with cash incentives. Because the loans will be backed by the city, low-income families can participate, even though their credit history might disqualify them for private loans. Ithaca’s reliance on private equity may be new, but the cash incentives and on-bill repayment programs have precedent in states around the country, such as New York and California. “We’ve seen this work,” said Ethan Elkind, the director of the climate program at UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy & the Environment. Utilities and municipalities have long been offering upfront dollars to ratepayers to encourage them to upgrade lightbulbs or home insulation. However, these types of improvements may be an easier sell than swapping out a gas range or fireplace. Consumer preference for natural gas appliances is one of the biggest barriers to home electrification. Cost is another. “If you have the money to do something to your house, putting in a new bathroom or kitchen is much more appealing to people than an invisible efficiency upgrade that pays for itself over eight years,” Elkind said. Anne Rhodes has a different view, however. The 76-year-old Ithaca homeowner, who earns about $20,000 a year, is using an existing state incentive program to insulate her home and replace her oil heating system with electric heat pumps. In addition to the climate impact, she said the upgrades will make her home more comfortable to live in. “That’s going to be enormous, that’s going to make a huge difference,” she said. Ithaca’s path could be a model for other cities, Elkind said, most of which have not figured out how to decarbonize buildings at scale. But there are a few caveats. The system only works in places with a municipally owned utility that allows for repaying the loans via bill savings. And whether those savings even exist depends on the rates for gas and electricity in a given market – in some cases, the cost of drastically increasing a home’s electricity usage could outweigh any reduction in gas costs. Ultimately voluntary schemes will never lead to full decarbonization, Elkind said. “We need to move to a mandate, but let’s start with the incentives and the marketing,” he said. California is one state headed in this direction. It recently approved a plan to require solar panels and battery storage in many types of new construction. In Ithaca, there are still challenges to overcome. Because it’s a college town, many buildings are owned by absentee landlords that will be hard to reach. Plus, even for local owners, clearly communicating a relatively complex funding structure may be difficult, Aguirre-Torres said. But he sees this new strategy as a critical piece of the city’s plan to address climate change, which he said cannot be accomplished without making sure everyone benefits. Rhodes agrees: “There’s no way we’re going to meet our goals for the climate crisis if we don’t help low-income people”.",8
environment/2021/feb/24/texas-renewable-energy-culture-wars,Environment,environment/2021/feb/24/texas-renewable-energy-culture-wars,Conservatives have blamed the state’s power fiasco on solar and wind even though they account for a fraction of supply,"The frigid winter storm and power failure that left millions of people in Texas shivering in darkness has been used to stoke what is becoming a growing front in America’s culture wars – renewable energy. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot), which oversees the Texas grid, has been clear that outages of solar and wind energy were only a minor factor in blackouts which, at their peak, left 4 million Texans without electricity, with many resorting to burning furniture or using outdoor barbecues to desperately warm themselves amid the shocking blast of Arctic-like conditions. Crucially, the supply of natural gas, which supplies about half of Texas’s electricity, seized up due to frozen pipes and a lack of standby reserves. The grid failed after about a third of Ercot’s total capacity – supplied by coal, nuclear and gas – went offline as demand for heating dramatically surged. Regardless, the Republican leadership in Texas, abetted by rightwing media outlets and a proliferation of false claims on social media, has sought to pin the crisis on wind turbines and solar panels freezing when the Lone Star state needed them most. “The Green New Deal would be a deadly deal for the United States of America,” Greg Abbott, Texas’s governor, told Fox News last week, in reference to a plan to rapidly transition the US to renewable energy that currently only exists on paper. “Our wind and our solar got shut down … It just shows that fossil fuel is necessary.” Abbott subsequently walked backed these comments but others have been less hesitant to use the crisis to attack renewables. Sid Miller, Texas’s agriculture commissioner, stated that “we should never build another wind turbine in Texas” on Facebook, while Tucker Carlson, the prominent rightwing Fox News host, said “windmills” were “silly fashion accessories” prone to failure. Fox News blamed renewables for the blackouts 128 times in just a 48-hour period last week, according to Media Matters. The distortions were amplified by social media, with a picture of a helicopter de-icing a wind turbine widely shared on Twitter and Facebook, even though the photo was taken in Sweden in 2014. A YouTube live stream by the conservative commentator Steven Crowder blaming the blackouts on “the failures of green energy” has been viewed about a million times, while the Texas Public Policy Foundation used paid Facebook adverts to urge people to “thank” fossil fuels for keeping them warm while assailing “failed” wind energy. The scorn heaped on renewables has echoes of the blackouts suffered by California during devastating wildfires last year, which caused several prominent Texas Republicans such as Dan Crenshaw, a member of Congress, and Senator Ted Cruz, who last week fled his stricken home state for sunny Cancún, to mock California’s shift to cleaner energy. The expansion of wind and solar, a key policy goal of Joe Biden, is now developing into yet another cultural battle line, despite strong public support for renewables. Jesse Keenan, an expert in climate adaptation at Tulane University, said the use of “targeted disinformation” and conspiracy theories is obscuring the more pressing issue of how states like Texas cope with the challenges of extreme weather linked to the climate crisis. “There are plenty of other comparable extreme events that are going to compromise the integrity of the energy system,” Keenan said. “These events are going to increasingly resonate in the monthly power bill. The question is do ratepayers want to keep paying to clean up a mess or do they want to invest in building resilience that will save them a lot more in the future?” Keenan said that much like how the US reacted to the 9/11 attacks by escalating its national security activity, the country now needs a similar level of response to the climate crisis by first taking basic steps, like weatherizing infrastructure and keeping reserve power in store, that Texas’s free-market grid system neglected to do. America has now “reached a turning point where the costs of disasters far exceed the amortized costs of upfront investments in resilience”, Keenan said. “Part of the impetus here is an acknowledgment that the status quo is unsustainable and we need to adapt our infrastructure and our way of life.” Transforming Americans’ power supply to renewable energy while bolstering resilience in the face of an unfolding climate crisis is a daunting challenge. Wind and solar energy need to increase their current capacity by up to five times by 2050 in order to reach net-zero carbon emissions, a Princeton report found last year, requiring nearly a 10th of the contiguous US to be covered in turbines and panels and thousands of miles of new power lines and substations in a revamped grid. All of this will need to happen as wildfires, flooding and storms are set to worsen due to global heating, with scientists finding last year that extreme rainfall in Texas alone will become up to 50% more frequent by 2036 than it was in the second half of the 20th century. Storm surges along parts of the Texas coast are set to double by 2050. If infrastructure is not prepared for this “the lights will probably go out again”, said Joshua Rhodes, a power grid researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. But Texas, much like several other states, appears wilfully unprepared for this reality. “We never hear the words ‘climate change’ spoken at Ercot because of the politics. It’s a taboo subject,” Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Austin, told the Houston Chronicle. “We’re using the past as a predictor of the future and we can’t do that. We’ve fundamentally shifted the planet’s systems, and it’s only just started.” The fallout from this political crusade against renewables will be felt heaviest among poorer communities and people of color who are already bearing the brunt of the climate crisis, heaped on top of a pandemic. “The last few days have been overwhelming,” said Nalleli Hidalgo, a Houston-based activist at the Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services, which has been attempting to help thousands of people lacking water, food and power. “Climate change will continue to hit coastal states like Texas the hardest, we need to invest in renewable energies and sustainable infrastructures, and create weatherized systems to prevent this from happening again.”",11

When it gets too hot or her asthma plays up due to the toxic coal ash from the nearby power plant, the 78-year-old widow rests on an adjustable hospital bed, clicks on the fan and thanks God for the solar panels on her roof. Earlier this year, Marrero was among two dozen residents in a low-income, predominantly Black neighbourhood blighted by coal pollution, fitted with a rooftop solar and storage system. Campaigners say systems like hers should be rolled out more widely to tackle the island’s energy crisis and the global climate emergency – both of which are exacerbating racialized health inequalities. The situation with the electricity is dire. Puerto Ricans can pay more than twice as much for electricity as Americans on the mainland, depending on which sector they are in, yet earlier this month power cuts to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses caused widespread anger and misery. Traffic lights failed, hospitals used expensive diesel generators to keep dialysis machines and ventilators running, and fires broke out due to fluctuations in voltage. Despite the abysmal service, electricity rates have increased four times so far this year. In hot and humid Guayama, the lights went out for several hours almost every day for those unable to afford a backup generator. But thanks to the rooftop solar system, Marrero could stay cool and watch TV without worrying about the food going off in the fridge. “It’s the best thing that’s happened to me. I thank God because my poor neighbours are suffering but I’ve always got electricity. I feel more secure, if we get another big hurricane like Maria, I won’t suffer so much,” said Marrero. Marrero is lucky because while Puerto Rico gets enough sunlight to meet its residential electricity needs at least four times over, less than 3% of the island’s energy comes from renewable sources. The rest is generated from imported fossil fuels: 49% from petroleum and 29% from natural gas, while coal accounts for 19%. Hurricane Maria was a wake-up call: it not only exposed Puerto Rico’s vulnerability to extreme weather events linked to global heating, but also focused attention on the economic and environmental ramifications of the island’s dependence on fossil fuels for local communities and greenhouse gas emissions. This gave rise to a social movement that came up with a plan called Queremos Sol, or we want sun – an evidence-based roadmap to make Puerto Rico’s energy system self-sufficient by swapping fossil fuels for onsite small solar grids distributed throughout the island. The concept is simple: a localized system that doesn’t require moving electricity from centralized power plants along overhead wires to local substations would be better equipped to withstand and recover from super storms and other natural disasters. Onsite batteries would better cover critical needs during disruptions. Experts say that such radical change is necessary to comply with Puerto Rico’s ambitious energy policy, which mandates that 40% of electricity must come from renewable resources by 2025 and 100% by 2050. It would also help the US comply with the Paris agreement, which Biden rejoined on the first day of his presidency, as well as the administration’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by investing in green infrastructure and jobs to address climate change and environmental justice. On the other hand, local authorities and the energy sector insist that more electricity must be generated to avoid shortages and power cuts – claims which campaigners dismiss as a ruse to justify further investment in gas and transmission infrastructure, as official documents suggest there’s enough capacity to cover demand. What’s agreed is that Puerto Rico is at a pivotal point and for once there’s real money on the table: last September, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) approved an unprecedented $9.6bn to reconstruct the island’s energy system and is currently deciding how the money should be spent. “Rooftop solar could supply all of Puerto Rico’s energy needs. It’s viable, sustainable and more reliable than the current centralized system that the energy industry and authorities want to rebuild,” said Ruth Santiago, lawyer and environmental policy expert who contributed to Queremos Sol. “We need the Biden administration to act. This is a critical time, a lot is at stake.” Puerto Rico is a tropical Caribbean archipelago and US territory located a thousand miles or so south-east of Miami. The main island is mostly mountains surrounded by narrow coastal plains where the majority of the 3 million habitants reside in towns and cities. Over the past two decades, Puerto Rico has been among three territories (along with Haiti and Myanmar) most affected by extreme weather such as storms, floods, heatwaves and droughts, according to the Germanwatch Climate Risk Index. In September 2017 hurricanes Irma and Maria made landfall two weeks apart and destroyed much of Puerto Rico’s electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure (including industrial wind farms), leading to the longest blackout in US history. About 3,000 people died in the aftermath as homes, businesses and healthcare facilities were left without power for months. Marrero was cut off for about 15 weeks, and recalls having to buy just enough food to last each day as she couldn’t afford a generator for the fridge or fan. In addition to increasingly frequent and intense catastrophic weather events, global heating is also causing slower changes such as rising sea levels and ocean warming that endanger the island’s infrastructure. But the climate crisis isn’t the only threat facing Puerto Rico: a 6.4 magnitude earthquake in January 2020 left two-thirds of residents without power, and significantly damaged the island’s two gas-fired power plants. In fact, much of the existing energy infrastructure (plants, transmitter towers, poles and cables) is in flood-prone areas or at risk of sea-level rise, storm surges and tsunamis, as well as strong winds and earthquake damage. It’s one reason why rooftop systems, not industrial farms, are proposed by Queremos Sol – as centralised renewable plants also rely on transmission and distribution lines. Rooftop solar relies on batteries and local distribution networks, which would be easier to fix if damaged. In addition, Puerto Rico lacks open land, so large-scale wind and solar farms would affect scarce agricultural lands and ecologically sensitive areas. It’s widely agreed that Puerto Rico’s energy system is in disarray. The publicly owned utility (Prepa), like Puerto Rico, is in bankruptcy and maintenance has been neglected for years. The latest spate of power cuts led to resignations at the top of Prepa, which is responsible for generating electricity, and angry public protests against Luma, the private US-Canadian consortium that took over transmission and distribution in June. What’s disputed is how quickly the island should move to renewables. Official documents show the government of Puerto Rico, Prepa and Luma want to spend most of the historic funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) on rebuilding the existing transmission system and new gas-fired plants, with only a fraction left over for renewables. Fema told the Guardian that Prepa and Luma have so far submitted 88 projects, but detailed work plans would be evaluated before final approval. Fernando Gil, the new chairman of Prepa’s board, told the Guardian that progress towards the legally binding renewable targets had been too slow, but denied vested interests were to blame. “We need to stabilize the system, generate more power and be proactive with maintenance while planning for renewables, but we have to be flexible … Gas is way cleaner and can be more efficient if combined with other fuels.” Yet Tomás Torres, the consumer representative on the board, said the utility should be investing in rooftop solar installation now. “Puerto Rico has the proper laws, regulations and funds to achieve energy transformation, it just has to be executed.” A Luma spokesperson said: “By key measures including reliability, customer service and safety, Puerto Rico has the worst electrical service in North America. It will take time and concerted effort to set it right.” As the battle for Puerto Rico’s energy future intensifies, for many ordinary people it’s a matter of life and death. In Guayama, 72-year-old Margarita Velázquez was diagnosed with COPD, a chronic respiratory condition, a few years after the nearby coal plant opened in 2002. “I stopped being able to breathe. I remember the doctor asked me how long I’d been smoking for, but I’ve never smoked!” On bad days, when coal ash hovers in the air over the community, Velázquez finds it hard to stop wheezing and needs an electric-powered nebulizer machine to open up her airways. The anxiety of losing power has gone since she was selected for the rooftop project. “It’s given me some peace of mind,” she said. At the nearby plant, a huge pile of grey ash laden with toxic heavy metals is waiting to be shipped to Florida and Georgia for disposal. When the wind picks up, the ash scatters through the air. For years hundreds of thousands of tonnes were dumped in landfills, roads and fields, contaminating the air and drinking water sources of mostly low-income neighborhoods. The coal plant has cost lives. Public health researchers have found higher rates of several chronic conditions among communities near the plant, including respiratory illness, heart disease, allergies and skin complaints. The incidence of cancers increased by 65% in the decade after the plant opened, while the numbers of patients with kidney failure requiring dialysis have also risen, according to Dr Gerson Jiménez, director of the Guayama hospital where he has worked for more than four decades. Amid growing backlash, the coal ash must now be removed, but huge toxic deposits remain scattered across the island and now others face the same deadly consequences. “It’s now being sent to poor communities of colour on the mainland, who can expect to see an increase in the same lethal diseases in years to come,” said Jiménez. Puerto Rico’s energy reforms, passed in 2019 with bipartisan support, mandate phasing out coal by 2028 (the company’s 25-year contract ends in 2027), but advocates argue that rolling out rooftop solar could make the plant obsolete sooner and therefore save lives. José Vázquez, 76, Velázquez’s husband and a member of Guayama Community United for Your Health – a group campaigning for the plant’s closure, cleanup and compensation – said: “There are big politicians and big interests in this struggle. We are in the middle like ham in a sandwich.” Perhaps there is another way. Adjuntas is a small mountain town surrounded by lush forests in the central midwestern part of the island where the temperate climate provides relief from the steamy coasts. Here, the solar power movement dates back more than two decades to a grassroots environmental group called Casa Pueblo, which organized the community to kick out a mining company before embarking on a crusade to make the town energy independent. Since Maria, hundreds of rooftop and onsite solar systems have been installed at homes, emergency services and critical businesses around Adjuntas, known locally as Pueblo Solar (Solar Town). The initiative relies on locally trained volunteers, donations and grants from groups like the US non-profit Honnold Foundation, and includes vulnerable households, a nursing home, fire station, community radio station and selection of general stores which serve isolated neighbourhoods stranded after the hurricanes. At the town’s picturesque main square, all 25 businesses – including a pizzeria, a pharmacy and hardware store – have created a micro energy network with a social justice twist: savings from generating and sharing their own energy will help fund solar systems for low-income residents who are homebound or need to keep medication refrigerated. On the edge of town, José Hernández runs a minimart which Maria partially destroyed and left without power for six months. The hurricane triggered a mass exodus to the mainland of mostly working-age folks left unemployed or homeless, but Hernández, 33, decided to stay and rebuild. It has been hard to expand the business as frequent power cuts force him to close the store and also damage the fridges, which are costly to repair. But six months ago Hernández obtained a grant for solar panels, and then used his savings to buy the other equipment. Since then, he has had uninterrupted power and his electricity bill has fallen drastically, allowing him to hire an employee. “It’s given me a sense of tranquillity. It’s exciting, I can now expand and invest in my future.” At its heart, this is a social justice initiative seeking to democratise access to energy, according to Arturo Massol from Casa Pueblo. “It’s anti-poverty, locally driven development as we believe clean renewable energy is a right for everyone, not just the privileged few.”  This article was amended on 25 October 2021. An earlier version said that Puerto Ricans pay more than twice as much for electricity as mainland Americans. The figures vary according to whether it is the residential, commercial or industrial sectors being compared; this has been clarified in the article.",12
environment/2021/mar/27/twiggy-forrest-sets-sights-on-making-the-impossible-possible-when-it-comes-to-pure-green-energy,Environment,environment/2021/mar/27/twiggy-forrest-sets-sights-on-making-the-impossible-possible-when-it-comes-to-pure-green-energy,But critics question the continued inclusion of gas in Andrew Forrest’s grand climate ambition,"In the second half of last year, while most of the world was in pandemic lockdown, Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest and a team of 50 staff did what others couldn’t. He spent five months crisscrossing the globe in a private jet, visiting more than 40 countries. It set Australia’s second-richest person on a path to an outcome that, if delivered, could transform the energy landscape of not just Australia, but the globe. The iron ore billionaire says after his private discussions with sovereign leaders, politicians, business people and investors across the world he was convinced of their “genuine thirst for our green energy”. “It made me strongly, and no longer hesitantly, optimistic,” he told Guardian Australia. “I felt a change in the global mood, a shift in belief, that the impossible could be possible.” Forrest’s response was to announce in November that his Fortescue Metals Group would aggressively support zero-emissions energy through its new green arm, Fortescue Future Industries. The initial pledge was that it would back 235 gigawatts of clean energy capacity – more than three times the entire Australian electricity grid – across the globe, with $1bn committed over the next two years. Four months on, that has expanded to a promise to explore more than 500GW of hydro, geothermal, wind and solar with a goal of being involved in the creation of 1,000GW. Forrest estimates the world will need at least 5,000GW of pure green energy to really slow the climate crisis. He has committed himself to helping develop a fifth of that by providing capital, technology and encouragement. It will, he claims, “create so much momentum and value that consuming energy from a polluting source becomes commercial nonsense”. He has big-name support: the former Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has signed on as chairman of the future industries arm, and the ex-Australian Secret Intelligence Service director general, Nick Warner, is a special advisor on international affairs. “We figure if we are able to set an example of a 1,000GW target then people will realise that the impossible isn’t actually impossible,” Forrest. “We’re hoping that other companies will get in and vigorously compete with us, and maybe even challenge and beat us, but what will happen in that process is global warming will slow and eventually stop. That’s our mission.” It is a pledge that sits alongside – and in some cases outstrips – support for fixing the climate crisis from some of the world’s richest people, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Like some of their commitments, it has drawn widespread praise for the agenda-setting and potentially transformative role it could play – and a fair dose of scepticism about whether it is possible. Forrest’s green ambition is too vast to quickly summarise. In addition to the global push, which he says has already led to deals in 17 countries, FMG this month set a domestic target of reaching net zero emissions by 2030, a decade earlier than it had previously promised, and 20 years before most competitors. Underpinning it is Forrest’s belief that green hydrogen, created using renewable energy, will change energy systems much faster than some analysts believe is possible. From there, he says, it can be used to create zero-emissions liquid green ammonia and turn iron ore into the holy grail of “green steel” – made without the current reliance on coking coal. Some of his goals will be tested in the short-term. In a speech to a Credit Suisse investment conference on Wednesday, Forrest said that by 30 June this year the company will have developed a green iron ore train that either runs on renewable electricity or a combustion engine powered by green ammonia. It also plans to be trialling a ship run on green ammonia, a shift that could lead to the replacement of the notoriously dirty bunker fuel currently used by fleets across the globe. Forrest says the pace of what he is proposing on shipping surprised and impressed the climate activist and former US vice-president, Al Gore, and puts him at least five years ahead of the global competition. Dan Gocher, from shareholder activists the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, is among those impressed. He says Forrest’s vision for FMG is “literally decades ahead” of other major companies. “They’re clearly the leading company on the Australian Stock Exchange in terms of ambition – and probably globally,” he said. “What he’s saying is what we’ve been calling on BHP and Rio [Tinto] to commit to – heavy investment in renewables to really kickstart the green hydrogen economy.” While his focus is on a green future, Forrest has not completely abandoned fossil fuels – at least not yet. This week, he was also speaking with the federal and New South Wales energy ministers, Angus Taylor and Matt Kean, about a proposal by his private company, Squadron Energy, to build a new 635-megawatt gas-fired power station at Port Kembla. If approved, it would initially run on liquefied natural gas (LNG) brought in via a new floating gas import terminal at the port. Forrest stresses both the plant and the terminal would be “dual-fuel” – a more expensive option that would give them the capacity to use green hydrogen once it is ready – but says he is making “an allowance for natural gas as a critical stepping-stone” to get the developments moving. The continued inclusion of gas in Forrest’s portfolio has drawn criticism. Gocher says it is at odds with Forrest’s green ambition, which he believes FMG has the capacity to deliver. “It is a bit hypocritical given the language he has used around the climate crisis,” Gocher said. “He’s clearly saying we need to take action in the next 10 years, but he wants to build a terminal that will supply more gas. It means he’s not talking about electrification [of industry] or trying to reduce [gas] demand, which is what we should be talking about.” Forrest takes umbrage when asked whether his gas developments are at odds with his climate push. “If it was just a gas-fired power station and a gas importation system, sure, take me to task,” he said. “But if I’m spending the huge amount of capital to make it dual-fuel – that’s hundreds of millions – and then on the other side of my life [spending] tens of billions to create that green energy and green hydrogen, then the Guardian really has to be responsible, and encourage people to take that big step and build dual-fuel so that they can switch to hydrogen when it’s available.” While the Morrison government has said it will back a “gas-led recovery” from recession, Forrest believes there is now no justification for leaders to support developments unless they also have the capacity to become zero emissions “when the fuel is available”. “It might be green electricity, it might be green ammonia, it might be green hydrogen. If you really care for what your citizens want, make sure you’re not building a dinosaur or licensing a dinosaur.” The bigger question about Forrest’s vision is whether the rise of green hydrogen is as inevitable as he believes. The nascent technology is now receiving significant support across the globe, and the Morrison government has named it a priority under its low-emissions technology roadmap. But it is still early days – relatively little hydrogen from any source is being produced and less than 1% of that is created using renewable energy. Tony Wood, the energy program director at the Grattan Institute, is among those who believe that while green hydrogen has a future, its ubiquity in a low-emissions world is not guaranteed. He doesn’t see a future for hydrogen-fuelled electricity, for example. “There are better ways to produce low-emissions power than with hydrogen and if we could produce low-cost green hydrogen there are better uses for it than electricity,” he said. Wood says he will be quick to applaud Forrest and other wealthy clean energy investors, such as software developer Mike Cannon-Brookes, if they use “their gift of the gab and capital raising ability” to bring forward and expand green hydrogen’s development. But he has his doubts. “If people want to put their money into it, great – good luck to them, I hope it works and they make a lot of money out of it,” he said. “Is it realistic? I expect a lot of it won’t be. But some of it might be and some of it might stick.” Asked how he responds to the sceptics, Forrest said: “I just say ‘track record’.” “I would much rather be doing this with a massive balance sheet, and cash flow, and a full industrial platform, and the weight of public opinion around the world behind me than when we started Fortescue with no technology, no capital, no resources and industry dead against us. “If people say it’s impossible, I say ‘think about what they’re doing in the next three months’. It’s setting an example on the industrial landscape that the Australian corporate community is fully supportive of – and I know that Australian governments will also support that.”",27
environment/2021/jul/28/oil-company-wind-power-wyoming-west,Environment,environment/2021/jul/28/oil-company-wind-power-wyoming-west,"Anschutz Corporation, which made billions drilling oil, is building a 732 power line to carry renewable energy to cities including Los Angeles and Phoenix","Some days, the wind rips across Wyoming’s southern plains at 70mph. Cottonwood trees bend, tall grass lies flat and 18-wheel trucks tip over along Interstate 80. It only takes a breeze of about 6mph to get the long white arms of an electricity-generating wind turbine turning, at full speed they can power thousands of homes. As one of the US’s windiest states, Wyoming has enormous potential to help power the country’s green revolution, but renewable energy in the west has long been dogged by a fundamental problem of transmission. Wind and solar farms tend to be located in remote areas separated from populated cities by hundreds of miles of rugged terrain, a tangle of government regulations and resistance from landowners who don’t want power lines buzzing over their yards. After more than a decade of trying, a corporation that made billions drilling for oil is poised to add a critical piece in the renewable energy puzzle. This month, TransWest Express LLC announced that it had acquired almost all the permits, permissions and partnerships needed to begin seeking customers for a 732-mile high voltage power line that would carry 20,000 GWh of renewable energy a year – roughly three-quarters of the energy needed to power Los Angeles – from southern Wyoming to a distribution hub near Las Vegas where it could tap into the grid that feeds Phoenix and Los Angeles. With extreme heat bearing down on desert cities, the Colorado River running so low that the Hoover dam’s energy production has dwindled by a quarter, wildfires raging from June through October and freak winter storms knocking out gas operations, western energy managers need new and diverse sources of power to avoid more blackouts. If it comes to fruition, the TransWest Express would provide crucial alternatives while helping western states meet their ambitious renewable energy commitments. The company behind TransWest, Anschutz Corporation, amassed a fortune in the 20th century in the oil-rich shale deposits of Wyoming. Today, the Denver-based corporation controls the Washington Examiner, the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and the Coachella music festival. It’s also the largest private oil and gas company in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, drilling on more than 155,800 hectares (385,000 acres). Anschutz , which has a deep rooting in fossil fuels, says it sees the potential in renewables and, specifically, the opportunity in overcoming the field’s debilitating transmission obstacle. But the path has been riddled with obstacles. “These big interregional connections across the whole grid system have not been built in decades,” said Kara Choquette, communications director for TransWest Express. The price of navigating the west’s regulatory quagmire is a significant deterrent, but TransWest is backed by a fossil-fueled empire. Anschutz also has a vested interest in connecting Wyoming wind to larger markets, because it happens to be building what would be the largest windfarm in North America on a ranch in Carbon county: the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Project, which could come online in 2026. Since 2008, TransWest has spent tens of millions of dollars to secure permissions across private and public land in 14 counties and four states, Choquette said. Historically, the sheer size of the region has limited connectivity. Whereas eastern states are generally small and tightly knitted, the American west encompasses some 1.8m sq miles. Currently, there is only about 136,000 miles of electricity transmission network, said Vijay Satyal, regional energy markets manager for Western Resource Advocates, a conservation nonprofit based in Colorado. On top of that, much of the infrastructure is ageing, and municipal utility companies have been reluctant to upgrade or join larger, more competitive interstate grids. “It is the fear of giving up, in many cases, expensive and less efficient systems,” Satyal said. “It’s like riding a clunker car down to the ground.” When it comes online around 2024, the TransWest Express will comprise two systems: a direct-current line suited to long-distance transmission between Sinclair, Wyoming and Delta, Utah, and an alternating current line linking the Utah terminal to southern Nevada and, eventually, beyond. Its support towers would reach 180 ft tall, and its 250-ft wide path would cross sagebrush, high desert and low montane forest. For that reason, the project has drawn concern from environmentalists worried its footprint would harm prime wilderness and sensitive habitat for vulnerable species like the desert tortoise and greater sage grouse. Wyoming is home to about 37% of the country’s remaining sage grouse, an iconic western bird whose populations have been reduced by housing development, oil and gas extraction and, especially recently, searing wildfires. Transmission infrastructure poses direct and indirect risks to sagebrush habitat and species like grouse, said Jeffrey Beck, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Wyoming. Some may fly into the wires, but more could die in fires fueled in part by invasive weeds that hitch a ride on work equipment or suffer predation from raptors and ravens that establish nests in overhead support structures. Generally, grouse tend to avoid tall things, and “It’s not like these animals have anywhere else to go,” said Beck. To address these concerns, TransWest proposed multiple routes that predominantly ride shotgun along existing infrastructure, like railroads and highways, and thread the needle between core habitat areas. As a result, the Bureau of Land Management and all the local natural resource departments along the way have approved the project. However, it’s not just environmentalists slowing the west’s renewable energy transition: wind power has struggled against those who see turbines as eyesores and those still deeply invested in coal. In Wyoming, the minerals industry has slowed renewable development by painting the wind and sun as unreliable and expensive, while repeatedly lobbying to raise taxes on the industry. And yet, the TransWest Express – a big green energy transmission project proposed by an oil company, that would run through areas of the west that have historically depended on resource extraction – points to a tectonic cultural shift. The cost of renewable energy is falling and investment in its development is rising. This is just one of at least 22 shovel-ready high-voltage wind and solar power transmission projects that could bump US generation by 50% and add more than 1.2m jobs, according to a report sponsored by Americans for a Clean Energy Grid. Still, “it takes time to build renewable energy projects,” Satyal said. The benefits of interstate renewable energy are clear today, but it hasn’t always been that way, and “utilities have not realized how fast that change would come”.  This article was amended on 30 July 2021. An earlier version wrongly stated that Anschutz Corporation “amassed a fortune in the 19th century”; the company was not founded until 1958.",15
environment/2021/sep/09/environmentalists-vow-to-block-woodchip-export-plan-in-nsw-hunter-region,Environment,environment/2021/sep/09/environmentalists-vow-to-block-woodchip-export-plan-in-nsw-hunter-region,"Startup energy firm’s bid to send up to 60,000 tonnes of woodchips to Japan for burning in power plants condemned by conservation group","Environmentalists say they will try to block a plan to export up to 60,000 tonnes of woodchips a year from Newcastle that would be used to fuel Japanese power stations. Energy startup Sweetman Renewables has signed a 20-year supply agreement with Sinanen Holdings to supply biomass to four biomass power plants in Japan. The company, which is seeking investor backing for its proposal, also says it intends to supply a woodchip-fed hydrogen plant in the Hunter region that it will establish in a joint venture with Singapore’s CAC-H2. The company’s chairman, John Halkett, said the plan was to construct a hub in the Hunter that would “use biomass to produce green hydrogen-rich syngas and related products like wood vinegar, biochar and activated carbon”. The Nature Conservation Council of NSW has criticised the proposal, saying any plan to export woodchips or use it locally for biomass fuel would be devastating for the state’s forests. “There is never an acceptable reason to trash our native forests, but turning them into woodchips to burn in Japanese power stations is utterly idiotic,” the council’s chief executive, Chris Gambian said. Sweetman Renewables is the owner of a sawmill at Millfield, near Cessnock, which was formerly operated by the Sweetman family. Halkett said the company would be sourcing the woodchips for its new ventures from existing sawmill and wood processing operations from the mid north coast region south of Kempsey. He said some of the material could also come from non-sawlog material from certified forestry operations. “We are not about felling trees other than those already authorised for harvesting under legal contractual log supply arrangements,” he said. “Sweetman is strongly committed to sustainable, certified forest management and the protection of forest biodiversity.” Woodchip exports from Newcastle ceased in 2013, which Gambian said followed a long campaign by the conservation movement. “Anyone thinking of investing in Sweetman Renewables should be made aware the conservation movement will not rest until this proposal is dead and buried,” he said. The former Australian Greens leader, Christine Milne, said there was “nothing green about logging and burning native forests”. “Trying to reframe logging native forests and the export of woodchips as ‘renewable biomass’ is the latest trick in the logging industry’s greenwashing playbook,” she said. “Biomass is just the logging and woodchip industry’s last ditch effort to keep a dying industry alive by logging native forests and exporting them to Japan and China to be burnt for energy in an age of climate and biodiversity collapse.”",2
environment/2021/jul/22/australia-has-huge-potential-to-develop-offshore-windfarms-near-existing-substations-report-says,Environment,environment/2021/jul/22/australia-has-huge-potential-to-develop-offshore-windfarms-near-existing-substations-report-says,Hunter and Latrobe valleys considered particularly suitable sites as union says industry could offer oil and gas workers a career transition ,"Australia has the potential to develop a substantial offshore wind energy industry from scratch, with abundant resources available near existing electricity substations across the continent, according to a new report. The Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre said Australia was yet to capitalise on significant offshore wind capacity despite the International Energy Agency nominating it as one of the “big three” likely sources of renewable energy globally alongside solar and onshore wind. It found more than 2,000GW of offshore wind turbines – far more than Australia’s existing generation capacity – could be installed in areas within 100km of substations. Environmentally restricted and low-wind areas were excluded from the assessment. Sites that have traditionally been electricity generation hubs, such as the Hunter and Latrobe valleys and Gladstone, were found to be particularly suitable as they were close to transmission grids and had strong offshore winds at times when solar and onshore wind output was limited. Dr Chris Briggs, research director at the University of Technology Sydney’s Institute for Sustainable Futures and a contributor to the report, said there had been a view in the energy industry that offshore wind energy would not play as significant a role in Australia as some other countries due to the availability of much cheaper solar and onshore wind energy. He said that was starting to change as people recognised the scale of the clean energy transition required and what offshore wind could deliver. “The combination of the scale, falling cost and the development of floating wind turbines means it has come into focus,” he said. Briggs said offshore wind could be built on a much larger scale than solar or onshore wind – up to 2GW for a project – and could generate more electricity per megawatt of capacity. “This could be very valuable in the late 2020s and 2030s as we see coal plants retiring,” he said. The project’s leader, Dr Mark Hemer of the CSIRO, said offshore wind could be particularly important under “energy superpower” scenarios that involved mass electrification of industry and transport and hydrogen production for domestic use and export. The report said there were 10 offshore wind projects with a combined capacity of 25GW in development in Australia, all at an early stage. The most advanced is the $10bn Star of the South – a 2.2GW windfarm planned for between 7km and 25km offshore in South Gippsland. The federal government is yet to finalise the regulatory framework necessary for an offshore wind industry to develop. The report said it could help develop an industry by supporting the technology through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, incorporating it into planning for the national hydrogen strategy, and considering allocation of marine space in commonwealth waters. The work was partly funded by the maritime, electrical and manufacturing unions. They called on federal and state governments to take immediate steps to support the development of an industry, saying it had the potential to create jobs for workers in fossil fuel industries. Paddy Crumlin, the national secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia, said the development of an offshore wind industry would give seafarers and offshore oil and gas workers an opportunity “to transition into the important work of delivering Australia’s clean energy future”. Offshore wind is more advanced in countries with limited capacity to develop renewable energy on land. The report said 2030 targets for offshore wind energy totalled about 200GW, including 60GW in the European Union, 40GW in Britain and 12 GW in South Korea. Japan plans to reach 45GW by 2040. Solar and onshore wind have grown substantially in recent years, leading to renewable energy providing nearly 30% of generation in the national electricity market. But the Morrison government also continues to support fossil fuels. A report by BloombergNEF and Bloomberg Philanthropies this week found Australia increased support for fossil fuel by 48% between 2015 and 2019, the largest rise in the G20. It said most of the support had been delivered in the form of tax breaks to oil and gas projects. They included tax capex deductions for mining and petroleum operations, fuel-tax credits and reductions in fuel-excise rates and offset schemes. Australia “lost out on nearly US$6bn in foregone taxes” over the five years, it said. The Bloomberg report did not include the Morrison government’s support for a “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic.

The details were revealed after a draft copy of the New South Wales 2020-2030 Clean Air Strategy, outlining proposals for stricter regulations around noxious emissions and CO2 standards for vehicles sold within the state, was leaked to the media. While the document raises concerns about pollution caused by wood-fired heaters in regional areas, its most ambitious proposal is for a plan to “harmonise” the state’s vehicle emissions regulations with European standards and encourage the uptake of electric vehicles. The New South Wales minister for environment, Matt Kean, declined to comment about any specifics as the strategy was still subject to cabinet processes. “Any changes NSW proposes to the national vehicle emission standards would only apply to new cars that are already available overseas. More importantly, cleaner vehicles are more fuel efficient, saving motorists money at the bowser,” Kean said. “I will always advocate for policies to stop NSW being used as a dumping ground for the world’s dirtiest vehicles.” While the plans have yet to be officially released in their final form, any New South Wales push to pass CO2 emissions standards may force the hand of the federal government. The move signals an evolving states-based approach on the issue of fuel efficiency and emissions regulations after decades of inaction by federal Labor and Liberal governments. After four years of consultation, the Morrison government released its “future fuels” strategy paper in February that was immediately slammed as a “do nothing“ document for rejecting stricter fuel efficiency standards. Should Victoria follow suit and introduce a plan to harmonise its fuel efficiency and emissions regulations with Europe, the country’s two largest regional economies would be covered by a stricter regulatory standard than that at a federal level. Victoria’s Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning was contacted for comment but did not respond by deadline. Australia’s loose attitude on noxious and CO2 emissions has made the country an outlier within the global vehicle market. Thanks to the regulatory black hole the country has become a dumping ground for thirsty petrol and diesel vehicles that are becoming increasingly difficult to sell elsewhere. The idea of state governments acting independently met a mixed response from industry bodies such as the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. Its chief, Tony Weber, said that his organisation supported stricter emissions and fuel quality standards for Australian vehicles, but leaving it up to the states risked creating a patchwork of regulations across the country that would be bad for business. “In an ideal world we would have a CO2 target,” Weber said. “We believe there should be a CO2 target and that it should be at a national level. “We can’t have every state and territory going off on a whim. This needs to be handled at a federal level. That’s why we’ve put in a voluntary standard for our members which represents the manufacturers of 99% of vehicles sold in this country.” His comments were echoed by the Australian Automotive Dealer Association chief executive, James Voortman, who said it was up to the federal government to ensure a consistent standard. “I can’t blame the NSW government for doing this if they think this is the right way to go,” Voortman said. “The question of fuel efficiency standards has been looked at by Labor governments, Liberal governments and for a number of reasons they’ve decided not to act. “We’ve seen the manufacturers themselves have signed up to a voluntary vehicle emissions standard. “So it’s something our manufacturers support and it’s something dealers support, and we’re increasingly noticing that it’s something customers want. If you take a close look there’s another story about the growth of hybrid vehicles, that’s been the standout over the last 12 months. So the demand is there.”",1

About a decade ago he withdrew $15,000 from his mortgage to install a 3.6kW system of panels on a north-east facing section of his roof in western Sydney. Three years ago, in a bid to wipe out his reliance on coal-fired grid electricity, he added a 4kW system and positioned it to catch sun later in the day, when it comes from the north-west. The sharp fall in the cost of solar in recent years meant the second system, though bigger than the first, cost just $5,000, a third of what he paid in 2011. Together, the two systems have all but wiped out his electricity bills – his last two brought refunds of about $100. Streatfeild is part of a rapidly expanding Australian story. About 2.8m households have solar systems, with another 3m expected to join them over the next decade. The flood of solar energy those houses create in the middle of the day when the sun is high is rapidly and dramatically transforming the electricity grid. At peak moments, slightly more than half the electricity across the national market is now from renewable sources, compared with about 30% across the year. In his first speech this week, the new head of the energy market operator, Daniel Westerman, set a target of the entire grid being able to run entirely on renewable energy, at least for brief moments, by 2025. According to regulators and some analysts, this solar influx, while welcome, is also causing potential problems by creating “traffic jams” in a system that was largely designed to send energy from a few large generators to homes and businesses. This prompted the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) in March to propose a change that could give network providers the power to charge people who export electricity into the grid at times when it is not needed. It argued the change was necessary to make room for more household solar systems and batteries to be connected to the grid, and to make the system fairer for all users. The commission, which makes rules for the electricity system, suggested two-way pricing that better rewarded solar and battery owners who send power to the grid at peak times – the early evening, for example. It also recommended new incentives that would give customers more reason to buy batteries or electric vehicles, or set up their homes to consume the power they generate at busy times. The proposal has proved divisive, pitting against each other those who want to see a rapid expansion of solar but who have different views about what is required to get there. From Streatfeild’s perspective, the potential new impost is unreasonable, but not surprising. A former police officer and member of the advocacy group Solar Citizens, he says he was motivated to get panels by the climate stance of the then opposition leader Tony Abbott and thoughts about the future his grandchildren faced. “I wanted to be able to say to them, ‘I didn’t fuck this Earth up for you, I did the best I could’,” Streatfeild says. He believes big electricity generators and networks have a history of profiteering and should bear any transformation costs, while solar consumers should be rewarded for bringing down the wholesale electricity price by undercutting ageing – and increasingly unviable – coal-fired power plants. “It’s really bad management by the network operators, in my opinion,” Streatfeild says. “They should have foreseen the need for all this. They seem to just want to screw us again.” Solar Citizens has a similar position. It has labelled the AEMC’s proposal a “sun tax”, and says solar homes and businesses should be rewarded for the benefits they provide, not penalised. “People have invested in solar in good faith,” says Ellen Roberts, Solar Citizens’ national director. “Any time that people have invested in something and the rules change it is breaching a fairness principle.” But arguments over fairness and solar power quickly become complicated – the same principle is invoked by supporters of the AEMC proposal. They say the change is needed in part to ensure a more equitable system for poor households that cannot afford solar panels and therefore bear a greater share of network charges.

Kellie Caught, senior adviser on climate and energy for Acoss, says the country needs a rapid transition to renewable electricity, but the question is who pays for it. Roughly a third of households are renting, so they can’t install solar panels and rely more heavily on – and pay more for – the poles and wires provided by electricity networks than those with solar. Caught says people with solar panels did not create the problem regulators are trying to address, but she believes the proposed rule change would benefit both grid security and consumers. “At the moment, the people who can least afford it are carrying more of the network costs,” she says. She says it is important the change empowers consumers with solar by giving them, and not network operators, the choice over whether they pay to export electricity at busy times or just accept a limit on how much they can send to the grid. Dylan McConnell, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne Climate and Energy College, also argues cutting emissions must be prioritised, but socially just. He cites research by the Grattan Institute in 2015 that suggests the effective subsidy paid by non-solar households to those with solar would be $3.6bn out to 2030. McConnell says at the heart of the debate is a question of whether household solar owners have a right to earn revenue by exporting to the grid, given they save money by using their self-generated solar energy at home, and whether that right comes with a responsibility to contribute to the infrastructure changes needed to ensure it is possible. Bruce Mountain, the director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, strongly disagrees. He argues the change proposed by the AEMC is based on a fallacy as the poorest households share the financial benefits of increased solar uptake at a level that far outweighs the additional network costs they face. He also suggests there is no evidence that more solar in the grid in the middle of the day is a problem that could not be addressed at low cost. “There simply isn’t good evidence of a problem to which export charging is a solution,” Mountain says. State governments have raised concerns about the change to varying degrees. Both Victoria and Queensland have indicated they do not support export charges. Some states have suggested grandfathering any cost so it does not affect people who already have panels. Other submissions to the AEMC argue to be effective the change must ensure solar owners who do what it wants – export their electricity when it is most needed – are well rewarded. They say it needs to become attractive to buy a household battery, or an EV that can both draw and export power to the grid. Neither technology has received the level of government support offered for rooftop panels when they were at similar levels of uptake a decade ago. Coincidentally or otherwise, the AEMC this week released a separate draft plan it says will make it easier for small battery owners to send electricity to the grid and earn revenue. The commission argues the average solar household with a system of between 4kW and 6kW will still do well after its proposed rule change. It estimates they will save about $900 a year on power bills – about $70 less than currently – and that households without solar would have their bills reduced as they would no longer have to pay for solar export services they do not use. It says alternatives to introducing an export cost, such as blocking people’s solar exports when the grid is under strain, or building more poles and wires to allow greater solar traffic, would be more expensive for consumers. The former would also have the effect of reducing the amount of renewable energy coming into the grid. The commission’s chief executive and chair, Benn Barr and Anna Collyer, emphasise that the rule change would not mandate an export charge, but allow networks to put forward proposals. The change would start in 2025. Barr says all governments support what he describes as a profound shift – a recognition for the first time that electricity networks need to take power from houses, not just get it to them. “What it means is those businesses now have an incentive and an obligation to upgrade the grid to get more solar, and be ready for when electric vehicles come,” Barr says. “It has kind of got lost a bit, but it will really change the ways those businesses do work, and benefit consumers across Australia.” A final decision on the rule change was initially due earlier this month but is now expected on 12 August.",5
environment/2020/nov/26/victorias-electric-vehicle-tax-could-reduce-clean-car-use-by-25-researcher-says,Environment,environment/2020/nov/26/victorias-electric-vehicle-tax-could-reduce-clean-car-use-by-25-researcher-says,"A charge on electric cars is ‘completely incongruent’ with states’ targets of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, Dr Jake Whitehead says","Victoria’s planned road user tax for electric vehicles will significantly hold back clean car use, according to research that found it could lead to a 25% lower share of sales in 2050 than otherwise expected. The Andrews government plans to impose a 2.5c a kilometre charge on electric vehicles (EVs) and a 2c/km charge on plug-in hybrid cars from July. South Australia is also planning an EV road user charge, but is yet to announce the rate. An analysis by Dr Jake Whitehead, from the University of Queensland’s Dow Centre for Sustainable Engineering Innovation, said federal government modelling had suggested EVs would be about 65% of new car sales by 2050, based on existing policies. Modelling of the 2.5c tax rate – undertaken before Victoria made its announcement – found this would be expected to fall to 40% if the additional cost was imposed without being accompanied by new incentives. Applied nationally, this would equate to at least 4.9m fewer EV sales. Whitehead said it would likely lead to greenhouse gas emissions from transport continuing to increase given the overall number of cars on the road were forecast to rise significantly and a greater proportion would run on fossil fuels. He said the EV per kilometre charge policy was “completely incongruent” with the states’ targets of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. A road user tax could make sense, he said, but should be accompanied by other measures that made buying clean cars more attractive, such as removing or reducing registration costs, stamp duty, GST and road tolls. Victoria has a $100 concession on registration for EVs and hybrids. Whitehead suggested this was not enough. “It is very easy to claim net zero targets, but there needs to be commitments to back it up and this is running in the wrong direction,” Whitehead said. Only about 0.6% of new cars sold in Australia are electric, a lower share than virtually all other OECD countries. National transport emissions have increased by 17% since 2005. The federal government promised a national EV strategy last year, but Scott Morrison attacked a Labor policy to promote the technology during the subsequent election campaign as a plan to “end the weekend” and the Coalition policy was later delayed. It has now been rolled into a “future fuels” policy, covering EVs, hydrogen and biofuels, with a consultation paper promised before the end of the year. The push to introduce road user charges for clean cars is based on the argument drivers pay for roads through a national excise on fuel, and EV drivers do not pay this charge. Critics of the plan point out fuel excise goes into general budget revenue and is not specifically dedicated to road funding, and that EV use needs to expand rapidly to cut emissions given the urgency of the climate crisis. The states believe introducing a road user charge will be easier now, when there is a small EV market and many owners are comparatively wealthy, and would be more politically challenging if left until the technology makes up a significant share of the new car market. An EV road user charge has also been considered by the New South Wales government and is supported by Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, an industry organisation, but is opposed by some politicians, including the NSW-based federal Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman. A Victorian government spokesperson said the tax was “a fair and sensible change that makes sure all Victorian motorists pay their fair share for the record investments in our roads network”. “The government has set a legislated target of net zero emissions by 2050 and we will be announcing a range of policies to deliver on that target,” they said. Whitehead said other countries had set clear targets to move to cleaner vehicles and backed it with incentives to encourage EV uptake. Britain last week announced a ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, Norway plans to phase out new fossil fuel cars by 2025 and the US offers a national US$7,500 tax rebate on EV purchases. He said claims by government representatives that higher taxes would not affect sales did not stand up. “I don’t know what school of economics they attended, but every economist will tell you if you increase costs then sales will decrease,” he said. “If these states want to get to net zero they’ve got to get real about this and stop trying to sell a furphy.” Whitehead’s study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed and has been released earlier than planned in the wake of the state government announcements, included a survey of 500 Queensland households on their preferences on road pricing. They found a 2.5c/km tax was seen as being equivalent to a $4,500 increase in a vehicle’s purchase price. By comparison, a $5 congestion tax charged on driving in inner-city areas, capped at $15 a day, was seen as equivalent to adding $2,800. A proposal to give a $1,000 credit on electricity bills to people who buy an EV was found to effectively reduce the cost of a new EV by $6,000. Removing existing road taxes – registration costs, stamp duty, GST and road tolls – would cut it by more than $11,000.",4
environment/2021/feb/19/australia-risks-being-left-behind-in-petrol-fuelled-parallel-world-as-other-countries-embrace-electric-cars,Environment,environment/2021/feb/19/australia-risks-being-left-behind-in-petrol-fuelled-parallel-world-as-other-countries-embrace-electric-cars,"Morrison government’s inaction is driving away chance to build a new low-emissions economy, industry experts say","Australia risks being left in a “parallel world” with petrol cars as the rest of the world turns to electric vehicles in an effort reduce carbon emissions. As Ford announced that all its cars sold in Europe would be electric by 2030, industry experts warned Australia faces an uphill struggle to catch up with other nations in preparation for the phasing out of the internal combustion engine. Australia’s lack of incentives to encourage more people to buy electric vehicles is also driving away potentially billions of dollars worth of investment and the chance to build a new low-emissions economy, they said. “It’s like we’re in a parallel world where manufacturers are having these big targets but countries like Australia are not keeping up,” said Behyad Jafari of the Electric Vehicle Council. “It’s like we are still trying to work out if the internet is a real thing or not while other countries are racing after the once in a lifetime opportunity to rebuild the automotive world.” Sales of EVs in Europe rose from 3.3% of all new cars in 2019 to 10.2% last year, while in Australia they increased from 0.6% to 0.75%. In contrast to many countries where governments are showering consumers with cash to encourage them to buy more electric cars, Australian motorists still face a significant disincentive thanks to the luxury car tax which pushes up the cost of many EVs. If you buy a new EV in the UK you get a tax subsidy of £6,000 (A$10,000), and around the same amount if you’re in the US, Germany and Italy. But Angus Taylor, the federal energy minister, maintains that using tax to encourage take up of electric cars is not good value for money. It would cost too much in terms of dollars per carbon saved, he told Sky News last week after launching the government’s fuel futures study. However, his estimate that subsidies would cost $740 per tonne of carbon was disputed by critics who say it does not account for knock-on benefits for the environment via lower emissions, and in public health improvements. Several countries have also announced plans to ban fossil fuel vehicles in the next 10 years. The UK has brought forward its ban to 2030 from an initial target of 2040. The move places it on a par with Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands, but behind Norway where sales of new fossil fuel cars will be banned by 2025. The Morrison government hopes that the market will drive the switch-over through more people buying hybrid cars that can run on batteries or a conventional engine. But there is scepticism about whether that will work. The EVC compared the Morrison government’s lack of strong incentives and action with the United States, where the new Biden administration has promised to replace all 660,000 government vehicles with EVs. Days after that announcement, General Motors said it was aiming to go all electric by 2035, and now its major rival, Ford, has signalled a similar shift in Europe. On Monday the British luxury make Jaguar Land Rover said that all its Jaguar models would be switched to electric by 2025, with the rest of its models moving over by the mid-2030s. It raises hopes that the big manufacturers could be selling their last petrol or diesel cars in the mid part of the next decade, paving the way for some countries to meet a net zero emissions target by 2050 as the last generation of gas guzzlers reaches the end of the road. With change looking increasingly likely, the motorists’ organisation NRMA is committing $10m to build a network of fast-charging stations in NSW and the ACT to overcome “range anxiety” – the problem where people are concerned that they will be unable to recharge their cars on long journeys. “We have to get ready whether we like it or not,” said NRMA spokesman Peter Khoury. The other major problem was the price of EVs which he said could be overcome in time with more choice for consumers, but also with tax incentives. Scrapping the punitive luxury car tax on EVs was a “no brainer”, he said, while greater awareness about the “astronomical” savings to be made on the day-to-day running costs of EVs would also help. Wider take-up of EVs could also help to soothe anxiety about fuel security in the wake of the closure of the Altona oil refinery and increased global instability. The government plans to spend $94bn on building a stockpile of crude oil but the need for such massive supply could be reduced by a switch to EVs. “We’d much rather people were driving around in cars powered by Australian electricity than in petrol cars running on fuel imported from some of the least stable nations in the world,” he said.",5

A “future fuels strategy” discussion paper released on Friday is largely consistent with a leaked draft in December. It does not include policies to make it more affordable to buy electric vehicles (EVs) or a phase-out date for the sale of new fossil fuel cars, as some other countries have announced. The government said its focus would be installing EV charging and hydrogen car refuelling stations where needed, encouraging businesses that wanted to include more low-emissions cars in their fleets and giving Australians “access to the right information to help them make informed choices’’. The paper notes the government’s emissions projections in December forecast that battery EVs would make up 26% of new car sales by 2030. The projections report found that pace of adoption would be associated with a 6% increase in transport emissions over the decade to 2030, a time in which the government is committed to cutting emissions and scientists and some global leaders, including US president Joe Biden, are urging much deeper cuts than currently planned. The emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said the government’s policy was based on the principle people should be empowered to make decisions about new technologies. “Australians should be able to choose the type of car they drive,” he said. The policy was sharply criticised by advocates and analysts who argue a rapid uptake of EVs is necessary for Australia to play its part in combating the climate crisis. Richie Merzian, the climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, said: “This is a climate policy that will ensure emissions continue to rise.” The Electric Vehicle Council said the discussion paper was a “flaccid, do-nothing document” that would prevent Australians getting access to the range of EVs available in other countries. The council’s chief executive, Behyad Jafari, compared Australia’s approach with what he said were accelerating incentive programs for EVs in other countries. He cited the British Conservative government’s allocation of more than $1bn in subsidies for EV buyers and charging stations as it attempts to phase out new fossil fuel cars by 2030. He said a rapid transition to EVs would lead to cleaner air, cut emissions and free the country from “our insecure dependence on foreign oil imports”. “Global leaders from Biden to Boris [Johnson] are rushing to accelerate their transition to electric vehicles, but Angus Taylor reckons he knows something they don’t,” Jafari said. EVs make up only 0.75% of new car sales in Australia, less than nearly all comparable countries, and it is one of few nations without emissions or fuel efficiency standards for passenger cars. The government announced plans for a national EV strategy in February 2019, before the last federal election. That was replaced last year with a broader approach that also covers hydrogen fuel-cell and biofuel powered vehicles. It has rejected introducing fuel efficiency standards, which would involve setting a target to lower the average emissions from the national vehicle fleet, despite a departmental analysis in December 2016 finding the benefits in savings on fuel and reduced emissions would outweigh the costs under all scenarios examined. Taylor said on Friday modelling had showed a fuel efficiency standard of 105 grams of CO2 per kilometre, which Labor had proposed before the last election following the 2016 departmental analysis, would increase the cost of cars by $4,863 and “force people out of the cars they love and into EVs”. He did not mention the finding that the overall benefits would outweigh the costs. The minister confirmed a budget pledge of $74.5m to be mostly spent on the rollout of charging infrastructure, but said the discussion paper showed direct subsidies would not be value-for-money for taxpayers as they were an expensive way to cut emissions. He said the cost would be reduced if commercial fleets switched to using cleaner cars as it would help build a second-hand market. Taylor said the paper also showed plug-in hybrid cars would have immediate emissions reduction benefits above EVs in most parts of Australia due to the high-level of emissions from Australia’s electricity grid. But Simon Holmes à Court, a senior adviser to the Climate and Energy College at Melbourne University and clean energy commentator, said this was a flawed analysis as it assumed a vehicle life of only five years, rather than a typical 15 years. It also did not factor in that people often charged EVs from their own rooftop solar panels, and that the three biggest EV charging networks in the country offered 100% zero emissions power, he said. “You have to work hard to make electric vehicle emissions look bad, and Angus Taylor has put in those hard yards,” Holmes à Court said. Taylor said Australians were “already making the choice to switch to new vehicle technologies where it makes the most economic sense”, with hybrid sales doubling last year. “We are optimistic about how quickly the technology cost will reduce for other electric vehicles compared to traditional cars, making it an easier choice for consumers,” he said. Labor’s climate change spokesman, Chris Bowen, said years of government inaction had left Australia with the lowest uptake of EVs in the developed world and car makers “no longer bothering to send their most affordable” cars to the country. He said Taylor and Scott Morrison had spent the whole last election campaign claiming EVs would “end the weekend”. “They’re asking voters to trust them when their ideology and neglect has made EVs more expensive for years,” he said. The Greens leader Adam Bandt said the government’s policy was “no carrot and no stick”. “This hands-off approach will make it harder for Australia to reduce emissions,” he said. Australia has become increasingly isolated on its approach to the climate crisis. More than 100 countries having supported a mid-century net zero emissions target as expected under the Paris agreement, but the Morrison government has resisted setting goal. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, this week said he wanted to meet net zero emissions “preferably by 2050” through low-emissions technology, not by imposing new costs, but has not explained how the government’s technology approach could get there. Several major car companies plan to phase out fossil fuel models. GM, which has been accused of not acting to address its emissions, recently announced it would be all-electric by 2035. The government has invited submissions on the future fuels discussion paper until 2 April, with a final policy promised mid-year.",1

They weren’t certain it would be. They were pleasantly surprised by the result. “We found not only is it not yet out of reach in Australia, but it can be achieved using technologies that are mostly already mature and available,” says Anna Skarbek, the chief executive of the not-for-profit that was established in 2009 to fill a gap between climate research and action. Net-zero emissions targets have been adopted by 121 countries responsible for a quarter of CO2, asset owners worth $4tn and an expanding list of major companies. The Morrison government is yet to join them, having promised a long-term strategy later this year, but all Australia’s states and territories have net-zero goals for mid-century. ClimateWorks spent 18 months examining each part of the Australian economy in detail to consider what would be involved in getting there. The resulting report, Decarbonisation Futures, is an update of similar work in 2014. It found net-zero emissions were possible not just by mid-century but by 2035 – soon enough for Australia to play its part in an effort to limit global heating to 1.5C. The report lands as the coronavirus crisis has, in a best-case scenario, postponed 2020’s expected focus on climate change. The year-end UN meeting in Glasgow has been delayed until next year. It is considered the most important since Paris in 2015, with countries being exhorted to ramp up commitments as promised in the French capital. ClimateWorks’ analysis was completed before the pandemic hit, but Skarbek says the need to recover from the economic shock once the survival stage passes will also provide an opportunity to make the sort of investment required to respond to the climate crisis. The former will demand a substantial stimulus program. The latter requires an “all-in” approach from governments, business and individuals in what the report calls “the transformational decade” before 2030. After that, the window for Australia to do its bit towards the Paris targets and prepare for a coming global zero emissions economy may have closed. Skarbek says it means a “make or break moment” is coming. The good news, she says, is many transformational climate-friendly steps are stimulus-ready. “If we get this right, we can meet Australia’s international climate change commitments, create jobs in sustainable industries, and set ourselves up for a smoother and speedier shift to a zero-emissions economy,” she says. “If we miss the moment of the stimulus injection to also accelerate on climate, the downturn will make it even harder to do what is needed over the next decade. I do worry we might miss this chance forever if we don’t seize it now.” The report finds the progress and fall in cost of clean technology since the last analysis six years ago has been faster than expected, with renewable energy becoming cheaper than fossil fuels and the cost of batteries plunging 80% in a decade. It says much of the shift needed now could be rolled out quickly by rapid and large-scale deployment of familiar technology. It would include upgrading homes and commercial buildings to boost energy efficiency and run on solar power; building more large-scale clean energy plants and storage; installing electric vehicle charging stations; boosting the use of recycled goods in supply chains; and supporting more carbon forestry by planting and protecting trees to store CO2. “It’s a lot of relatively small transactions that get this job done,” Skarbek says. “That’s why it is stimulus-friendly.” The analysis found the difference between making cuts consistent with 1.5C and 2C of heating were noteworthy, but not always that great. The lower goal was likely to mean renewable energy providing 79% of power by 2030, compared with 73% for 2C and 48% if we continue on the current path without governments introducing further policies. On electric vehicles, a 1.5C path could require three out of every four new cars sold in 2030 being electric, compared with one out of two on a 2C path. The government has projected EVs will make up one in five new sales by then. Deployment of available tech to make rapid cuts in electricity, buildings and transport is easier than in heavy industry, agriculture and the land, but Amandine Denis-Ryan, ClimateWorks’ head of national programs, says there are emerging solutions in those areas. One may be hydrogen, which governments are backing as a potentially plentiful clean energy source for use in transport and industry, and to export. While the report acknowledges green hydrogen is likely to have a part to play, it does not assume how big that role will be, given it is a relatively new industry and there is little data to back it up. But Skarbek says it is a potential answer to two big questions: what can be done in those parts of the economy, particularly in heavy industry, that cannot easily shift to running on clean electricity? And what industries can fill the gap created by Australia’s reliance on fossil fuel exports? Denis-Ryan stresses the report reveals both what is possible and the urgency of the task. Achieving the Paris goals will require national emissions being cut in half by 2030 at the latest. “We now know we have enough technological capacity in the Australian economy to get there,” she says. “But we need to get these technologies out the door at every opportunity.” The analysis found electricity is key – getting to 100% clean energy will help clean up other parts of the economy. It suggests no significant increase in storage is needed to get from where we are today, at about 25% clean energy, to 50%. Pumped hydro and batteries are mature and available technologies for when that boost is required. Hydrogen may play a role, and demand-response programs, microgrids and inertia control technology are all considered at demonstration stage and could be rapidly scaled up to improve grid security. But the key factor determining the pace of the electricity transition is the speed at which coal and gas plants are closed. The analysis suggests over-building renewable energy to 200% capacity – double what the country needs – could be more cost-effective than building to 100%, and would spark new clean export opportunities. As with electricity, the technology for zero-emissions building already exists. It would involve improving energy efficiency through insulation and draught sealing and by installing LED lighting, solar hot water and efficient heating, cooling and appliances. It could mean the introduction of passive house design standards to conserve energy, the use of electrochromic windows that allow owners to control the amount of light and heat that passes through them, and smart systems that optimise when and how power is used. But much of it would be driven by a shift to clean energy, replacing gas-fired heating and cooking with heat pumps and induction stovetops. Transport is not as easy to tackle as electricity and buildings, but the analysis found it could reach near zero emissions by 2050 through improving travel practices (using more electrified mass public transport and video-conferencing for business), shifting to electric vehicles and replacing fossil fuels with biofuels, and possibly renewable hydrogen and ammonia. Industrial emissions have been rising rapidly in Australia, effectively cancelling out reductions in electricity generation and drought-affected agriculture before the coronavirus pandemic. They are harder to cut and would leave considerable “residual” emissions by 2050 based on existing technology. Improved efficiency, fast-tracking a circular economy in which metals, plastics and timber are recycled and reused and 3D printing plays a bigger role, electrifying mines and steel operations where possible, and shifting to renewable fuels are (to varying degrees) available solutions that could lead to deep cuts. Immediate cuts are possible through better use of energy, including onsite renewables at farms, substituting some meat products for plants and better management of waste and fertiliser. Other changes such as using vaccines to limit methane from livestock, and shifting to lab-grown meat, are emerging technologies and need greater support for rapid rollout. Reaching net-zero emissions in the medium-term would involve expanding use of forests to store carbon to offset the sector where, based on today’s technology, the complete eradication of CO2 is not yet possible. But the report warns this is a temporary solution. The country cannot reforest land forever, and trees are vulnerable to bushfires, drought and heatwaves, which are exacerbated by climate change.",11
environment/2021/aug/20/electric-car-batteries-what-happens-to-them,Environment,environment/2021/aug/20/electric-car-batteries-what-happens-to-them,"The quest to prevent batteries – rich in raw materials such as cobalt, lithium and nickel – ending up as a mountain of waste","A tsunami of electric vehicles is expected in rich countries, as car companies and governments pledge to ramp up their numbers – there are predicted be 145m on the roads by 2030. But while electric vehicles can play an important role in reducing emissions, they also contain a potential environmental timebomb: their batteries. By one estimate, more than 12m tons of lithium-ion batteries are expected to retire between now and 2030. Not only do these batteries require large amounts of raw materials, including lithium, nickel and cobalt – mining for which has climate, environmental and human rights impacts – they also threaten to leave a mountain of electronic waste as they reach the end of their lives. As the automotive industry starts to transform, experts say now is the time to plan for what happens to batteries at the end of their lives, to reduce reliance on mining and keep materials in circulation. Hundreds of millions of dollars are flowing into recycling startups and research centers to figure out how to disassemble dead batteries and extract valuable metals at scale. But if we want to do more with the materials that we have, recycling shouldn’t be the first solution, said James Pennington, who leads the World Economic Forum’s circular economy program. “The best thing to do at first is to keep things in use for longer,” he said. “There is a lot of [battery] capacity left at the end of first use in electric vehicles,” said Jessika Richter, who researches environmental policy at Lund University. These batteries may no longer be able run vehicles but they could have second lives storing excess power generated by solar or windfarms. Several companies are running trials. The energy company Enel Group is using 90 batteries retired from Nissan Leaf cars in an energy storage facility in Melilla, Spain, which is isolated from the Spanish national grid. In the UK, the energy company Powervault partnered with Renault to outfit home energy storage systems with retired batteries. Establishing the flow of lithium-ion batteries from a first life in electric vehicles to a second life in stationary energy storage would have another bonus: displacing toxic lead-acid batteries. Only about 60% of lead-acid batteries are used in cars, said Richard Fuller, who leads the non-profit Pure Earth, another 20% are used for storing excess solar power, particularly in African countries. Lead-acid batteries typically last only about two years in warmer climates, said Fuller, as heat causes them to degrade more quickly, meaning they need to be recycled frequently. However, there are few facilities that can safely do this in Africa. Instead, these batteries are often cracked open and melted down in back yards. The process exposes the recyclers and their surroundings to lead, a potent neurotoxin that has no known safe level and can damage brain development in children. Lithium-ion batteries could offer a less toxic and longer-lasting alternative for energy storage, Fuller said. “When a battery really is at the end of its use, then it’s time to recycle it,” Pennington said. There is big momentum behind lithium-ion battery recycling. In its impact report, published in August, Tesla announced that it had started building recycling capabilities at its Gigafactory in Nevada to process waste batteries. Nearby Redwood Materials, founded by the former Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel, which operates out of Carson City, Nevada, raised more than $700m in July and plans to expand operations. The factory takes in dead batteries, extracts valuable materials such as copper and cobalt, then sends the refined metals back into the battery supply chain. Yet, as recycling becomes more mainstream, big technical challenges remain. One of which is the complex designs that recyclers must navigate to get to the valuable components. Lithium-ion batteries are rarely designed with recyclability in mind, said Carlton Cummins, co-founder of Aceleron, a UK battery manufacturing startup. “This is why the recycler struggles. They want to do the job, but they only get introduced to the product when it reaches their door.” Cummins and co-founder Amrit Chandan have targeted one design flaw: the way components are connected. Most components are welded together, which is good for electrical connection, but bad for recycling, Cummins said. Aceleron’s batteries join components with fasteners that compress the metal contacts together. These connections can be decompressed and the fasteners removed, allowing for complete disassembly or for the removal and replacement of individual faulty components. Easier disassembly could also help mitigate safety hazards. Lithium-ion batteries that are not properly handled could pose fire and explosion risks. “If we pick it down to bits, I guarantee you, it’s not going to hurt anyone,” Cummins said. Success isn’t guaranteed even if the technical challenges are cracked. History shows how hard it can be to create well-functioning recycling industries. Lead-acid batteries, for example, enjoy high rates of recycling in part due to legal requirements – as much as 99% of lead in automobile batteries is recycled. But they have a toxic cost when they end up at improper recycling facilities. Spent batteries often end up with backyard recyclers because they can pay more for them than formal recyclers, who have to cover higher operating costs. Lithium-ion batteries may be less toxic but they will still need to end up at operations that can safely recycle them. “Products tend to flow through the path of least resistance, so you want to make the path which goes through formal channels less resistant,” Pennington said. Legislation could help. While the US has yet to implement federal policies mandating lithium-ion battery recycling, the EU and China already require battery manufacturers to pay for setting up collection and recycling systems. These funds could help subsidize formal recyclers to make them more competitive, Pennington said. Last December, the EU also proposed sweeping changes to its battery regulations, most of which target lithium-ion batteries. These include target rates of 70% for battery collection, recovery rates of 95% for cobalt, copper, lead and nickel and 70% for lithium, and mandatory minimum levels of recycled content in new batteries by 2030 – to ensure there are markets for recyclers and buffer them from volatile commodity prices or changing battery chemistries. “They aren’t in final form yet, but the proposals that are out there are ambitious,” Richter said. Data could also help. The EU and the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), a public-private collaboration, are both working on versions of a digital “passport” – an electronic record for a battery that would contain information about its whole life cycle. “We are thinking about a QR code or a [radio frequency identification] detection device,” says Torsten Freund, who leads the GBA’s battery passport initiative. It could report a battery’s health and remaining capacity, helping vehicle manufacturers direct it for reuse or to recycling facilities. Data about materials could help recyclers navigate the myriad chemistries of lithium-ion batteries. And once recycling becomes more widespread, the passport could also indicate the amount of recycled content in new batteries. As the automobile industry starts to transform, now is the time to tackle these problems, said Maya Ben Dror, urban mobility lead at the World Economic Forum. The money pouring into the sector offers an “opportunity to ensure that these investments are going to be in sustainable new ecosystems and not just in a new type of car”, she said. It’s also worth noting that sustainable transport goes beyond electric cars, said Richter. Walking, biking or taking public transportation should not be overlooked, she said. “It’s important to remember that we can have a sustainable product situated within an unsustainable system.”",3
environment/2021/nov/26/what-happens-when-americas-coal-plants-die,Environment,environment/2021/nov/26/what-happens-when-americas-coal-plants-die,"Facing economic and environmental pressures, coal plants are closing across the US, leaving communities to work out how to keep afloat","When the coal-fired power plant just outside the tiny town of Nucla, Colorado, closed in 2019, it had the makings of a disaster. The plant, which opened in 1959, shut down three years ahead of schedule when it ran out of coal, leaving the town shocked and facing the loss of its largest employer. The facility provided nearly half the tax revenue to the region, said Deana Sheriff, executive director of the West End Economic Development Corp, which serves Nucla and the surrounding area between Telluride and Grand Junction in western Colorado. Left without vital funding for its fire department and school district, the town was terrified about its future. But despite the early plant closure, and an unemployment rate that more than doubled overnight, Nucla had done enough to prepare. The town has leaned on tourism, driven by outdoor activities, and the recent opening of dozens of small businesses to survive. “Initially we saw a lot of frustration and concern, mostly about selling homes and folks moving away,” Sheriff said. But the town has adapted fairly well, she said: “We’ve diversified our economy enough that we’re not going to die because one industry went away.” Increasingly outpaced by cheaper alternatives, including renewables, and under pressure from climate concerns, at least two dozen US coal power plants – many of them in small, rural communities – are expected to close or downsize in the next 10 years, as are most of the coalmines that supply them, according to the Environmental Protection Agency and experts. Most coal communities face the same challenges as Nucla: how to replace the jobs and tax dollars that have kept these towns afloat for decades? In some cases, such as in Nucla, local officials started planning early. In others, the closures appear to have taken leaders by surprise. The huge Navajo Generating Station in northern Arizona, within the Navajo Nation, also shut down in 2019. Local leaders complained that plant operators closed the facility decades ahead of schedule, although the region did have two years to prepare after the announcement. Little planning appears to have preceded the closure. “What does ‘prepare’ mean?” said the Coconino county supervisor Lena Fowler. Regional leaders didn’t see many options for replacing the money and jobs as the closure loomed, she said. The lack of preparation in Arizona – compounded by the subsequent pandemic that shut down tourism in the picturesque region near the Grand Canyon and a drought that has devastated the popular boating destination Lake Powell – has had dire consequences. Coconino county has lost $40m a year in property taxes since the plant, just outside the town of Page, closed, Fowler said. Families have been separated as one parent left for a job at another power plant, and there are concerns the Navajo Nation could cut essential services because of the tax losses. A second Navajo power plant, Four Corners, is due to close in the next decade, as is the Cholla plant just outside the Nation. A nearby coalmine on the Hopi reservation, which supplied the Navajo Generating Station, has also closed. The Navajo Nation president, Jonathan Nez, did not respond to an interview request. “The Nation didn’t do enough planning,” said Nicole Horseherder, a Navajo water rights activist who leads the Tó Nizhóní Ániup environmental non-profit. “They should have been planning for this the day the coal plant signed the leases. We can’t just be dependent on something we knew wasn’t going to last for ever.” Cultural and regional differences have a huge bearing on how communities prepare and recover from a coal plant closure. Secluded towns that have relied on coal for decades – including power plant jobs that pay an average of $90,000 or more – can be reluctant to talk about a coal-free future. And don’t even bring up solar or wind power in some places. “Renewables, for the workforce there, are the antichrist,” said Clint McRae, who owns the Rocker Six Cattle Company near the Colstrip coal power plant in Montana and is a member of the Northern Plains Resource Council, an advocacy group that fights for water quality protections. Some communities remain very loyal to coal and consider energy sources such as solar and wind as a threat to their way of life. “It’s a very difficult subject to talk about over there. It’s going to take time to absorb in the community,” McRae said. The Colstrip plant is scheduled to be retired in 2025, according to its operator’s latest estimates, and McRae and others worry about the pollution it will leave behind. Like other plants, Colstrip has been collecting coal ash – a toxic byproduct – in ponds. That pollution has seeped into the groundwater. Coal ash can often be the most dangerous legacy of a closed plant. In 2014, 39,000 tons of ash and 27m gallons of contaminated water from a plant owned by Duke Energy that had closed two years earlier spilled into North Carolina’s Dan River. Duke Energy has two other plants in North Carolina’s Person county that are expected to close within six years. Among those who have tried to get the community to transition its coal-based economy is state senator Mike Woodard, who admits it’s been a tough hill to climb in an area that has yet to accept the reality of coal’s future. “Person county is going to have to accept that there’s a new way of doing business there,” said Woodard, a Democrat who helped negotiate the state’s recently enacted clean energy law. Renewable energy, not coal, is the future, he added. “We’re all going to be in the rowboat together and it would be great if we were rowing in the same direction.” Some states have done better than others helping to row the boat. With a slew of coal closures coming to Colorado, the state has established an office to help communities plan for the transition. Led by director Wade Buchanan, the Office of Just Transition has tried to steer local officials and residents away from the coal v renewables argument and to think about the transition in more economic terms. Buchanan compares the transition to that faced by timber communities in the Pacific north-west, which successfully transformed their economy when lumber mills began to close. “I think we make a mistake thinking about this as uniquely coal-related or uniquely energy-related,” Buchanan said. “There is a cultural factor that makes it unique. But when you step back and think about how to transition away from this, there are other places that have relied on one industry or employer for a while.” Buchanan pointed to Nucla as an example of how to manage that transition effectively, with more than 100 diverse small businesses opening in the area since the plant closed, thanks in part to tax breaks and other financial incentives. States and outsiders need to let rural communities figure out their own transitions, he said. The Nucla area has leaned on its strengths to recover from the closure, Sheriff said. Residents are trying to open small bed and breakfasts rather than large hotels. Sheriff’s organization runs a grain mill for local businesses and is considering building a meat processing plant to make life easier for local ranchers. Other new businesses include catering companies, coffee shops, organic markets and ATV rentals. Residents have made it clear they like Nucla’s quiet atmosphere, Sheriff said, and they don’t want to replace the coal plant with huge distribution centers or call centers or offices. “We’re not asking Google to come in and create a new tech location here,” she said. “It’s finding the right mixture of businesses that want that rural lifestyle. We’re isolated and we like it that way.” The Nucla model isn’t always replicable in less picturesque areas. While western Colorado and the region near the Navajo Generating Station are obvious tourism destinations, it can be difficult for other communities to replace coal dollars with tourist dollars. Amanda Ormond, who formerly led the Arizona energy office and now is a director with the Western Grid Group, urged community leaders to think about their unique assets and then to research federal funding options to make the most of them and fill the gaps. Then there’s the question of what to do with the sites of shuttered plants. Utilities across the country have discussed replacing coal plants with gas-powered plants, which has been criticized by activists who urge an end to fossil fuel use, while other plants have become college athletic facilities, restaurants and cannabis growing sites, according to Bloomberg. Communities should look at non-energy possibilities for old power plants, relying on facilities already in place, Buchanan said. “There’s often railroad, water rights, transmission lines,” he said. “There’s a lot of energy infrastructure and that’s an asset to build on.”",0
environment/2021/sep/18/semiconductor-silicon-chips-carbon-footprint-climate,Environment,environment/2021/sep/18/semiconductor-silicon-chips-carbon-footprint-climate,"As demand for chips surges, the semicondutor industry is trying to grapple with its huge carbon foot print","The semiconductor industry has a problem. Demand is booming for silicon chips, which are embedded in everything from smartphones and televisions to wind turbines, but it comes at a big cost: a huge carbon footprint. The industry presents a paradox. Meeting global climate goals will, in part, rely on semiconductors. They’re integral to electric vehicles, solar arrays and wind turbines. But chip manufacturing also contributes to the climate crisis. It requires huge amounts of energy and water – a chip fabrication plant, or fab, can use millions of gallons of water a day – and creates hazardous waste. As the semiconductor industry finds itself increasingly under the spotlight, it is starting to grapple with its climate impacts. Last week Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest chipmaker, which supplies chips to Apple, pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The company aims to “broaden our green influence and drive the industry towards low-carbon sustainability”, said the TSMC chairman, Mark Lui. But decarbonizing the industry will be a big challenge. TSMC alone uses almost 5% of all Taiwan’s electricity, according to figures from Greenpeace, predicted to rise to 7.2% in 2022, and it used about 63m tons of water in 2019. The company’s water use became a controversial topic during Taiwan’s drought this year, the country’s worst in a half century, which pitted chipmakers against farmers. In the US, a single fab, Intel’s 700-acre campus in Ocotillo, Arizona, produced nearly 15,000 tons of waste in the first three months of this year, about 60% of it hazardous. It also consumed 927m gallons of fresh water, enough to fill about 1,400 Olympic swimming pools, and used 561m kilowatt-hours of energy. Chip manufacturing, rather than energy consumption or hardware use, “accounts for most of the carbon output” from electronics devices, the Harvard researcher Udit Gupta and co-authors wrote in a 2020 paper. A global shortage of high-end chips, as the pandemic boosted demand for electronics and Covid outbreaks closed fabs, has increased focus on the industry. In a tight market, automakers found themselves at the back of the chip queue, far behind much bigger-scale semiconductor customers such as Apple, who use the chips to give computing power to their smartphones, laptops and other devices. GM halted production in several of its North American factories this month, while Toyota said it would cut its carmaking by 40% in September. In an attempt to increase production, many countries are embarking on big programs to boost the industry. The Chips for America Act proposes $52bn in funding over five years for the US semiconductor industry. The EU has forwarded its own legislation aimed at increasing its share of the global chips market to 20% by 2030. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, called it “a matter of tech sovereignty” in her State of the European Union address last week. These ambitions line up a potential clash with international climate goals. Both the EU and US aim to get halfway to net zero carbon emissions by 2030, and to net zero by 2050. And as the semiconductor industry grows, so too will its carbon footprint. However, amid pressure from investors and electronics makers keen to report greener supply chains to customers, the semiconductor business has been ramping up action on tackling its climate footprint. “Recently, I started seeing our effects on the environment completely come to the forefront,” said Sohini Dasgupta, principal design engineer at ON Semiconductors. Two years ago, she said, the industry “was sitting on the fence, in the middle of the pack, saying: ‘Yes, sustainability is important, but we don’t know what to do with it’”. But now she sees movement: “Every day it pops up in our emails, what our company’s doing, what other companies are doing,” she said. The rise of ethical investing has helped, according to Mark Li, a semiconductor analyst at the investment firm Bernstein. Fund managers increasingly market “green funds” and investors are asking more questions about companies’ environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impact. “Over the last three years, the voice of ESG investment is much louder than before,” Li said. Ultimately, this changes how companies behave, he added. Greater availability of renewable energy is helping chipmakers reduce their carbon footprint. Intel made a commitment to source 100% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, as did TSMC, but with a deadline of 2050. Energy consumption accounts for 62% of TSMC’s emissions, said a company spokesperson, Nina Kao. The company signed a 20-year deal last year with the Danish energy firm Ørsted, buying all the energy from a 920-megawatt offshore windfarm Ørsted is building in the Taiwan Strait. The deal, which has been described as the world’s largest corporate renewables purchase agreement, has benefits for TSMC, said Shashi Barla, renewables analyst at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. As well as guaranteeing a clean electricity supply, it pays a wholesale cost and removes itself from price shocks, “killing two birds with one stone”, he said. TSMC’s actions have the potential to influence the rest of the industry, said Clifton Fonstad, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, “other manufacturers are likely to follow its lead”. As well as switching to renewables, chipmakers could also implement efficiencies in fabs, said Peter Hanbury, a semiconductor manufacturing expert at the management consultancy Bain & Company. A chip fab is basically “a gigantic warehouse with a clean room inside”, he said, and to cut emissions, “the easy part is the facility itself”. Fabs could be more efficient in regulating air and water temperature, humidity, and pressure. They could segment warehouses so one production line had high pressure, and another lower, using less energy than keeping the entire warehouse at a high pressure. They could capture more data and use machine learning to turn tools off when they weren’t being used, said Huili Grace Xing, an engineering professor at Cornell University who works on semiconductor materials. There is also innovation aimed at tackling the worst-polluting materials used in making semiconductors. The chip industry uses different gases during the production process, many of which have a significant climate impact. TSMC said it had implemented scrubbers and other facilities to treat gas emissions. But another route is replacing “dirtier” cleaning gases that clean the delicate tools in semiconductor manufacturing, said Michael Pittroff, a chemical engineer working on semiconductor gases at Solvay Special Chemicals. In industrial tests over the last six years with about a half dozen chipmaker clients, Pittroff said, he and his team had replaced more polluting gases with “cleaner” fluorine, with a lower global warming impact. Other companies target the gases that are used to etch patterns onto and clean the silicon surface of a wafer – the thin piece of material used to make semiconductors. Paris-based industrial gases company Air Liquide, for example, has come up with a line of alternative etching gases with lower global warming impacts. But replacing gases will be a challenge: anything that touches the silicon wafer, such as an etching gas, is really hard to alter once a fab is operating, said Hanbury. The process involves a huge amount of precision. Fabs have to place up to 100m transistors on a postage-stamp sized wafer and need to do it perfectly. It takes four to five years for fabs to develop a recipe for this and “once you set it, you basically never want to change it”, Hanbury said. Some experts believe chipmakers will start to modify their processes to incorporate greener gases, especially if the big players make a move. “If TSMC switches, I am sure the others will,” said Fonstad. “If TSMC doesn’t, then other manufacturers may switch to show they are better than TSMC.” To some observers of the chip business, the determination to clean up the industry seems real. The vast demand for chips at the moment will only help the semiconductor industry embrace sustainability goals, said Li. “They have very good margins, and make lots of money. So even though all these green carbon measures would have a cost, they can afford it. And increasingly, customers are willing to pay more for a greener device,” he said.",8
environment/2021/nov/11/low-carbon-aviation-fuels-activists-stay-grounded,Environment,environment/2021/nov/11/low-carbon-aviation-fuels-activists-stay-grounded,Fuel made from waste and synthetic ‘e-fuels’ could reduce emissions significantly but scaling up quickly will be an immense challenge,"A powder blue airplane flew from London to Glasgow in September to deliver on a promise. Airlines around the world have committed to decarbonizing the industry – the British Airways flight was meant to demonstrate a decade of progress toward that goal. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made partly from recycled cooking oil, along with more efficient engines, a sleeker design and improved air traffic management helped reduce the flight’s carbon emissions by 62% compared with a similar trip in 2010, according to BA. The airline was able to bill the trip as “carbon neutral” because it bought carbon credits to offset the remaining 38% of emissions. In demonstrating how far aviation has come, the flight showed the industry is far from carbon free. Commercial aviation emitted 918m metric tons of carbon in 2019, about half of which came from frequent flyers. The industry makes up about 2.5% of annual global emissions, but that figure will grow. Passenger travel rose nearly 300% between 1990 and 2019 and the pre-pandemic increases in traffic outpaced emissions savings from improved aircraft and air traffic efficiencies. Emissions could triple in the next three decades, according to some predictions, if aviation returns to its pre-Covid growth trajectory. The industry has been slow to decarbonize, in large part because fossil fuels continue to be by far the cheapest and easiest way to fuel planes. But there is movement. In October, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) committed to reach net zero emissions by 2050, following a slew of net zero commitments this year from large European and US airlines. To meet these targets, they are relying heavily on sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is seen as something of a holy grail for decarbonization, especially as zero-emissions aircraft powered by hydrogen and electricity are a decade or more away from commercial operation. Made from non-fossil-fuel feedstocks including cooking oils and agricultural waste, SAF could cut carbon emissions as much as 80% compared with conventional jet fuel, according to Iata. Research has shown that the use of SAF can also reduce engine soot and contrails, which have an even greater warming effect on the planet than aviation’s carbon emissions. And as a “drop-in” fuel that can be blended with kerosene, SAF is compatible with existing aircraft fuel systems. Dozens of aviation and energy companies – including Delta, American Airlines and BP – recently committed to replace 10% of global jet fuel with SAF by 2030. The problem is it’s expensive – up to eight times more than conventional jet fuel – and there’s not that much of it. About 100m litres (22m gallons) of SAF will be produced in 2021, according to IATA, a fraction of the 449bn litres (119bn gallons) the group estimates will be required by 2050 to keep to net zero commitments. Environmental advocates also warn that if demand for SAF is met by using crops as feedstock it may lead to deforestation to clear land and could compete with food production. Some scientists are hoping to help SAF scale by exploring the potential of waste. Derek Vardon, a researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Colorado, investigates ways to make fuel from “wet waste”, including food scraps and municipal wastewater. “Despite a lot of recent buzz around increasing SAF production, there’s a limited amount of non-food fats, oils and greases to use,” he said. By diverting food waste that was destined to decay in landfill, Vardon and his colleagues say they can create SAF with a carbon footprint up to 165% lower than conventional jet fuel. US wet waste has the potential to replace roughly 20% of the country’s jet fuel consumption, according to a study co-authored by Vardon. At the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington state, Corinne Drennan, manager of bioenergy technologies programs, researches the potential of SAF that’s brewed from industrial waste gases. “These waste gases that have carbon in them can come from steel mill manufacturing, from refineries, from landfill gas, from lots of different places,” she said. Carbon-rich gases are fermented into ethanol and converted into a hydrocarbon fuel. Various feedstocks might supply the market for SAF, she said, “and as you aggregate [feedstocks], you begin to build impact.” One of the most hyped fuels for cutting emissions is synthetic fuel, also known as e-kerosene, e-fuel and power-to-liquid fuel. Made with carbon dioxide and hydrogen (produced from water using renewable energy), it can be used in existing fuel systems. “There is potentially an unlimited amount of renewable electricity to use for e-kerosene,” said Andrew Murphy, director of aviation for Transport & Environment, a green campaign group based in Brussels. When created using renewable electricity and carbon capture, synthetic fuel is nearly carbon neutral. In January, KLM flew a plane from Amsterdam to Madrid in what the company called the world’s first flight powered by synthetic fuel. Synthetic fuel made up around 5% of the fuel; the rest was conventional jet fuel, but the company said it was a step towards more widespread adoption. The German airline Lufthansa joined aviation and energy groups including Transport & Environment to write an open letter in July urging the EU to set ambitious goals for synthetic fuel production and has partnered with the transport company Kuehne+Nagel to buy 25,000 liters a year. Yet synthetic fuel is very expensive compared with conventional jet fuel and remains exceptionally limited in supply – and is likely to stay that way for at least the next decade. To scale up would require policy support and huge investment in the expansion of green energy infrastructure to provide enough electricity and carbon. Increasing the production of renewables like solar and wind power to supply synthetic fuel will be “very costly”, said Brandon Graver, a senior researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT). A lack of supply continues to be the big challenge to scaling up SAF from all sources, said Graver. “There needs to be a lot more investment,” he added. In the US, SAF production will take decades to scale, according to the Biden administration’s plan. The White House has set a goal of supplying 35bn gallons of SAF by 2050 but the US now produces only about 4.5m gallons a year. Europe’s shift to SAF is also likely to be a decades-long process. A recent report from the ICCT estimated that the bloc has the potential to produce 898m gallons of SAF by 2030 – 5.5% of projected jet fuel demand. The EU is considering a proposal that would require fuel suppliers to blend at least 2% of SAF into conventional jet fuel by 2025, 5% by 2030, and 63% by 2050. But while policymakers pin their hopes on alternative fuels, climate advocates question whether aviation has the tools to decarbonize within the narrow timeframe available. “They haven’t got the technologies for a genuine path to decarbonization,” said Cait Hewitt, policy director at the Aviation Environment Federation, a UK non-profit. Reducing aviation’s carbon impact will require sweeping changes to the industry and aggressive efforts to keep airplanes on the tarmac, she said. While passengers are increasingly given the option of offsetting their flight emissions, a number of investigations have found offset schemes to have serious credibility problems. Flying less often is one of the most climate-conscious lifestyle choices a person can make, according to research from Lund University in Sweden. That’s especially true for the 1% of the global population who produce 50% of aviation emissions. Abandoning air travel is a tough proposal to sell, particularly when many countries lack cheap, efficient and comprehensive rail networks. It’s an “escapist and unrealistic approach”, said Kwasi Adjekum, a professor of aviation at the University of North Dakota. “The reality is that air transportation is an essential part of global commerce and [the] supply chain network for goods and passengers.” But as research increasingly suggests that growth in aviation is incompatible with emissions goals, a growing number of people have committed to staying grounded. Some are driven by guilt; many have been inspired by climate activist Greta Thunberg. The “flight shame” movement Thunberg helped inspire was credited as one reason for a 4% drop in commercial flights in Sweden. It will take years to ramp up SAF production and even longer to develop zero-emissions aircraft, said Murphy from Transport & Environment: “Right now, flying less is the most effective way to reduce aviation emissions.”  This article was amended on 12 November 2021 to clarify that 50% of aviation emissions are produced by 1% of the global population, not “1% of flyers”, as an earlier version said.",14
environment/2021/jul/26/climate-crisis-green-light,Environment,environment/2021/jul/26/climate-crisis-green-light,"Facing a reckoning over their contribution to the climate emergency, companies are coming out with a record number of pledges","For climate campaigners, 26 May seemed like the start of a long-awaited reckoning for oil and gas companies. Over a single 24-hour period, a Dutch court ordered Shell to dramatically cut emissions, shareholders voted to force Chevron to reduce emissions from the products it sells, and a tiny activist investment firm secured three positions on ExxonMobil’s 12-member board for candidates committed to climate action. When trying to ascribe responsibility for the climate crisis, it’s hard to overstate the outsized role fossil fuel companies have played. The products of just 100 private and state-owned fossil fuel companies were linked to 71% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a groundbreaking 2017 report. A subsequent Guardian investigation in 2019 found 20 fossil fuel companies, including Chevron and ExxonMobil, were responsible for more than one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions since 1965 – the point at which experts say fossil fuel companies were aware of the link between their products and climate change. But it’s not just fossil fuel companies fueling the climate crisis. Even if we immediately phased out oil and gas, emissions from agriculture alone may make it impossible to limit warming to the 1.5C goal in the Paris agreement. Across a slew of sectors from food and fast fashion to construction and heavy industry, companies have helped drive climate chaos. As climate impacts accelerate – the world is boiling, burning, flooding and melting – there is unprecedented pressure on all companies to start taking their own role in the crisis far more seriously. This pressure is translating into action. A record number of companies are making climate pledges, but experts warn the pace of action remains glacially slow in the face of a barreling climate crisis. Even if all current Paris agreement climate pledges are met, the world is still set to see temperature rises of about 2.4C by the end of the century – well above the 1.5C of warming that scientists say will already lead to severe climate impacts. As countries are under pressure to up their climate ambitions in the run-up to Cop26, the vital UN climate talks in November, the private sector is also being increasingly pushed by investors, employees, activists and consumers to take meaningful action. In response, corporations have put out a flurry of climate commitments. At least a fifth of the world’s 2,000 largest public companies have now made some kind of “net zero” pledge to cancel out their carbon emissions. They are investing billions in clean energy, moving to electric vehicles, pledging to halt deforestation, and urging the US government to step up climate action. Tech companies have perhaps some of the most far-reaching goals. Last year, Microsoft pledged to be “carbon negative” by 2030, meaning it would remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits. By 2050, it aims to have compensated for all of its historical emissions through carbon removal projects. Apple says its products and supply chain will be carbon neutral by 2030 and Google has committed to be powered exclusively by renewable energy by 2030 and claims it has already wiped out its carbon footprint by offsetting emissions. Most oil companies are moving far more slowly. Shell, BP, Total and Equinor have announced plans to reach “net zero” emissions by 2050, but few have committed to halt fossil-fuel exploration. Some have gone much further and completely transformed their business model: Danish firm Ørsted sold its oil and gas business in 2017 and has now installed more than a quarter of the world’s offshore wind capacity. The transport industry, responsible for around one-fifth of global CO2 emissions, is gearing up for bolder climate pledges. GM Motors announced in January it would be carbon-neutral by 2040 and sell only zero emissions vehicles by 2035. The aviation sector, which has been slow to make climate pledges, is considering whether to set a goal of becoming net-zero by 2050. Large numbers of companies, including consumer-facing firms such as Ikea, PepsiCo and Levi’s, are also signing up to the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which helps companies calculate emissions targets aligned with the Paris agreement ambition of 1.5C. More companies have signed up in the first half of 2021 than in the whole of 2020, according to a Bloomberg report. “A decade ago, companies were setting these very incremental targets,” said Cynthia Cummis, co-founder of the SBTi and director of private sector climate mitigation at the World Resource Institute. “Now science-based target setting is becoming standard practice.” And it’s having an impact. An SBTi analysis of 338 large companies with science-based pledges found they had reduced combined emissions by 25% between 2015 and 2019. Corporations are losing the ability to “fudge the numbers” on climate policies, said Ketan Joshi, an Oslo-based climate analyst who tracks company climate pledges. “Companies are increasingly starting to understand that they’re losing their grip on the public relations hit of announcing a climate ambition and then doing nothing about it.” There are still big caveats. Global emissions are rebounding post-pandemic and 2023 is on track to see the highest levels of CO2 emissions in human history, according to the International Energy Agency. Despite the record number of corporate climate pledges, an analysis of 9,300 listed companies from index provider MSCI published in July found that they are still on course to exceed their “carbon budgets” – the total amount of emissions they can release and still keep in line with 1.5C of warming – within the next six years. This finding highlights the need for these companies to “dramatically accelerate climate action”, said Remy Briand, head of environmental, social and governance at MSCI. “It is easy to say that becoming net-zero is a high priority, but it is another to take action, especially immediate action.” While some companies have placed climate change at the top of their agenda, he added, others have made weak pledges or failed to act at all. “For those not matching their commitments or lagging, there should be nowhere left to hide.” Analyzing what companies are actually doing, however, can be painstakingly difficult when there is no requirement to disclose all key climate information and little consistency in corporate pledges making it all but impossible to benchmark progress. The changes required are so vast that many companies struggle to even articulate them. In an evaluation of some of the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters, the investor engagement group Climate Action 100+ found no company has fully disclosed how it plans to reach net-zero. With many corporate net-zero pledges still several decades out, often with few interim targets, monitoring their effectiveness can be hard. “We cannot wait for 2050 to see whether we fulfil the commitments or not,” said Gonzalo Muñoz, UN high-level champion on climate for Cop25. “It’s what we do today, and in these next five to 10 years, that will determine whether we succeed or not.” Figuring out how to quickly cut emissions is not an easy task for companies, which must work out not only how to reduce direct emissions and those from the energy that they use (scope 1 and scope 2 emissions), but also those which come from the use of their products (scope 3 emissions). Some of the boldest pledges rely on carbon removal technologies that don’t even exist yet, or at least not at the scale required. Many more are heavily reliant on carbon offsets, which allow companies to invest in “nature-based” programs like tree planting or forest protection to counteract their own emissions. Offset projects, however, have been plagued by allegations of flawed accounting, greenwash and sometimes even of actively fueling climate change. These climate pledges are also voluntary. To some, this shows that industry is trying to take responsibility for its own emissions. For others, it looks more like an effort at self-regulation to avoid government intervention. “I don’t think we have time for voluntary corporate initiatives any more,” said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. “We’ve done them for decades and they haven’t worked. I think there’s a real need for governments to be coming in and putting in place some legislative and regulatory frameworks.” Many companies have publicly called for governments to take stronger climate action; behind the scenes it can be a different story. Amazon and Microsoft, for example, have been criticized for pitching themselves as climate leaders while also donating tens of thousands of dollars to politicians who oppose climate action. An Amazon spokesperson said it actively advocates for clean energy policies and a spokesperson for Microsoft said that to make progress the company “must engage with candidates and officeholders who hold a range of views”. The lobbying efforts of fossil fuel majors, meanwhile, are well documented. The five largest publicly traded oil and gas companies spent over $1bn on misleading climate-related branding and lobbying in the three years following the Paris agreement in 2015, according to a 2019 report by InfluenceMap. A host of investigations has revealed big fossil fuel companies knew about the link between their products and climate change for decades but continued to argue that climate science was uncertain and to push against climate action. Just last month an Exxon lobbyist was caught on tape by the investigative outlet Unearthed describing how the company was actively working against key US climate policies through lobbying and membership of trade associations. These same firms also encouraged a public narrative of individual responsibility for the climate crisis. British Petroleum notoriously helped to popularize the term “carbon footprint” with an online calculator that encouraged people to measure their own emissions. This focus on personal responsibility is echoed in other sectors, which advertise “more sustainable” products while continuing business-as-usual models of consumption and production. “The discussion that moves us away from corporate responsibility to personal responsibility is a huge distraction,” said Shannon Lloyd, an assistant professor of management at Concordia University in Canada. “As an individual, your choices have very little impact in terms of reducing the carbon or other environmental footprint of products. It’s more about getting laws put in place or policies in place than individual purchasing decisions.” Reaching a net-zero world will entail “wholesale transformation” in both infrastructure and how things are done, said Steven Clarke, director for corporate clean energy leadership at non-profit Ceres. “Some people refer to it as on the scale of a second industrial revolution.” Certain key sectors will face big challenges. There’s a lack of easy answers for some energy-intensive industries with huge carbon footprints, such as steel, cement, aviation and shipping, which are notoriously hard to decarbonize. Sectors which rely on high consumption of products with big climate footprints, such as fast fashion and meat, will also need to adapt significantly for the world to limit temperature rise to 1.5C. But there is huge potential for innovation and action. Most solar and wind projects are now expected to be cheaper than coal. Investment is flowing into “green hydrogen”, which could provide zero-emissions fuel for ships and airplanes and replace fossil fuels in steel manufacturing. Meanwhile, pressure on companies is intensifying. More than 1,500 lawsuits have been brought against fossil fuel companies. This number could accelerate thanks to advances in climate science making it easier to link climate damage to corporate activity. Employees are another lever for change. In 2020, hundreds of Amazon workers criticized the company for climate inaction last year. This year the non-profit ClimateVoice launched a campaign mobilizing employees to demand that big tech companies spend more of their lobbying dollars on climate policy. Companies cannot tackle the climate crisis by themselves, said Jamie Beck Alexander of Project Drawdown, a non-profit focused on climate solutions, “regulation will absolutely be required to transform entire sectors.” But this doesn’t let them off the hook, she added. “If business leaders truly grasped the seriousness of this crisis, they would immediately pivot their entire business models and resources toward scaling climate solutions full stop.”",8
environment/2021/nov/05/us-free-parking-spaces-climate-cost,Environment,environment/2021/nov/05/us-free-parking-spaces-climate-cost,Street parking takes up space and incentivizes driving. New curb management companies are trying to help cities better use this space,"The street space occupied by parked cars may not seem like much, but it adds up. The US has an estimated 3.4 spaces for every car. In New York City, the amount of road space reserved for parking is roughly the size of 12 Central Parks, according to one estimate, and most of the city’s 4m street parking spots are free. “The curb lane is some of the most valuable land on Earth,” said Donald Shoup, a transportation professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “I think that’s our biggest mistake, to take some of the most valuable land on Earth and give it away, free, to cars.” Street parking doesn’t just take away space. It can inform how people get around. “Parking is one of the things that has a really powerful impact on people’s decisions whether to drive or not,” said Daniel Firth, transportation director at C40 Cities, a network of more than 100 cities around the world with ambitious climate goals. Shoup and others have found that underpriced street parking keeps people driving in cities, even in those that have good alternative transport options. More people driving means more city traffic – increasing congestion and pumping out pollution. But cities that want to price, or even convert, free street parking face obstacles – and not just from drivers. Most cities don’t have enough information about how their curbs are used, making it difficult to decide how to manage this valuable space. Companies offering curb management technology have sprung up to try to fill this gap, with promises to help cities reclaim their curbs. Their digital platforms map parking spaces and curb use around cities. Having the information in one place and being able to visualize curb spaces on a map is vital, said Peter Richards, who leads the development of software product CurbIQ at Canadian consulting company IBI Group. CurbIQ was born out of years of working on parking strategy projects for cities and realizing cities don’t have easily-accessible, digitized information about their curbs, Richards said. The endgame is to help cities reduce car numbers – along with congestion, noise, and pollution – while making better use of spaces and still meeting people’s mobility needs. The prospect of snagging a free or cheap street parking spot compared with an expensive off-street spot keeps drivers cruising, said Shoup, who has led surveys of drivers stopped at city traffic lights to ask them why they are driving. In one instance, 68% of the drivers surveyed in a Los Angeles neighborhood were cruising for a parking spot. The availability of free street parking can also inflate car ownership. A study of the four biggest cities in the Netherlands, found that higher parking costs in city centres accounted for about 30% of the lower car ownership rates compared with the outskirts. “You can reduce car ownership quite significantly by making parking more expensive or by reducing the amount of parking you build,” said Jacob Baskin, the co-founder of Coord, an NYC-based curb management company. And there is data to show city residents may prefer less parking. A survey of London residents found that their top choice for using curb space was to plant trees, Shoup said. Parking ranked fifth. One of the first steps that CurbIQ and Coord do for cities is to lay out digitized information about the existing permitted uses of curbs on a map – usually by driving around and using machine vision software to capture the street signs – forming the foundation of a city’s curb management platform. “It’s a lot easier to make decisions and plan when you have all this information together,” said Richards. During Covid, the political barriers to reclaiming curb spaces from free street parking were removed, said Maya Ben Dror, who leads transportation at the World Economic Forum. Commuters started working from home, freeing up parking spaces. Meanwhile, restaurants and other businesses needed outdoor space in cities. That allowed curb management companies to really grow during the pandemic, she said. Cities used Coord’s platform, said Baskin, to figure out “here’s where we have space where we think we can repurpose, to either be restaurant seating or pickup and drop-off space, in ways that will benefit the city”. During the summer of 2021, IBI staff used CurbIQ’s software to help the City of Toronto launch its CafeTO program that allowed restaurants to set up patios on appropriate curb space – identifying those far enough away from fire hydrants, traffic intersections or transit stops. Having a map of curb spaces and their regulations helped the city move quickly, said Richards. Coord is working with cities such as Aspen, Colorado, to designate smart zones – curb spaces reserved for gig and delivery drivers to book through an app when they are approaching their destinations. Home deliveries and ride-shares continue to rise in popularity and drivers need temporary curb space to complete pick ups and drop offs safely. When free street parking dominates, drivers either have to circle around the neighborhood looking for parking or simply double park, holding up traffic, increasing pollution, and endangering pedestrians and bicyclists. “Double parking can really snag up traffic,” said Baskin. “People hate it.” Smart zones could help cities manage the competition for curb space among these drivers and ease congestion from their cruising, said Ben Dror. Both Coord and CurbIQ are working to quantify the tangible benefits, such as reduced emissions. Many businesses will reflexively object to the conversion of free parking spaces in front of their shops, fearing a loss of customers. But often, business owners overestimate how much their customers are arriving by car, said Firth. A study in Seattle found that sales revenue increased 5.4% among downtown restaurants after paid parking hours were extended, Richards said, because more customers were coming and going. “Instinctively, everyone’s like if you got rid of free parking, our business will die. That is wrong,” he said. Street parking is so ubiquitous that converting it feels like a loss. It is a powerful psychology that makes many resistant to the idea, said Firth. “We value the loss of something much greater than the gain of something else.” The patios, parklets, and bike lanes that took over street parking spaces during the pandemic has shown the possible uses of a city curb other than to store empty cars. “There’s been this little space where we can demonstrate, first of all, the loss of the parking was maybe not as bad as people thought, and the gain of the patio was way better than people thought it would be,” Firth said. Converting space could also help cities move more efficiently and more sustainably, said Ben Dror. Cars travelling on a single 10-ft-wide lane move about 1,600 people an hour in cities, whereas converting the same lane to a protected, two-way bike lane, for instance, would allow 7,500 people to get around. A lane delineated for transit, whether for buses or trains, could move 8,000 people an hour, she said. “If we were to use a lane, which is a public space, more efficiently, we would seek to use it for something that is healthier for people and for the air.” Any efforts that help us shift away from driving and towards shared and active modes of transport such as walking, biking, scooting, or public transit are key to tackling the climate crisis, said Ben Dror. Making systemic changes in the way we get around could help prevent an additional million tons of carbon emissions a year by 2050, on top of those saved by electrifying vehicles, she said. And as the time that we have left to limit climate change effectively dwindles, every ton of greenhouse gas that we don’t emit counts.",-3
environment/2021/aug/23/blueprint-for-emissions-reduction-major-industry-policy-changes-needed-for-australia-to-reach-net-zero,Environment,environment/2021/aug/23/blueprint-for-emissions-reduction-major-industry-policy-changes-needed-for-australia-to-reach-net-zero,"As emissions from industrial sites increase, Grattan Institute recommends a new future fund be set up similar to the national green bank","Greenhouse gas emissions from Australia’s industrial sites have risen 24% since 2005, and need to be addressed now if the country is to have a chance of reaching net zero by 2050, a new report says. The Melbourne-based think tank Grattan Institute has released a blueprint to reduce emissions from major industry, citing government projections that without action they are expected to stay around current levels until 2030. It recommends policy changes such as improving Australia’s failing “safeguard mechanism”, creating an “industrial transformation future fund” similar in design to the national green bank, and expanding state energy savings schemes. The report found an economy-wide carbon price backed by support for technology development would be the most efficient way to cut emissions, but deemed this “politically out of reach” and focused on policies the institute believed could be introduced under either the Coalition or Labor. It was released as the Morrison government invited industry to have its say on the design of a promised new “safeguard crediting mechanism”, which it says will help big energy-using businesses adopt new technologies to cut costs and emissions. The emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said the new mechanism – which was flagged last year following a review of the government’s climate policies headed by former Business Council of Australia president Grant King – would award carbon credits to industry for “transformative abatement projects”. If successful, it could address criticisms of the operation of the safeguard mechanism, which was introduced under Tony Abbott to place a limit on industrial emissions, but that in practice has allowed companies to repeatedly increase pollution without penalty. Critics have expressed concern it could lead to big emitters receiving government handouts for little public benefit if not well designed. The government allocated $279.9m in the May budget to the new mechanism. The industrial sector, not counting electricity generation, is responsible for 31% of Australia’s emissions. That proportion has grown as annual industrial emissions leapt from 130m tonnes in 2005 to 162m tonnes in 2019. The increase was mostly driven by an expansion of gas and coal exports. Government projections released in December suggested industrial emissions were expected to still be at about the 2019 level in 2030. Scientists, political leaders and diplomats have said global emissions need to be cut roughly in half by then for the world to be on track to meet the goals of the Paris agreement. Tony Wood, Grattan Institute’s energy and climate change policy director, said every decision the industrial sector made would have repercussions on emissions lasting decades. Governments needed “to send the right signals”, he said. “Current policies place little to no downward pressure on emissions, nor do they encourage development of new low-or-zero-emissions industrial capacity,” he said in the report. “From now on, every decision to renew, refurbish or build an industrial asset potentially locks in emissions for the coming decades. Getting these decisions right will be critical for reaching net zero.” The Grattan report broke down industrial emissions into three main groups – fugitive emissions that escape during fossil fuel extraction, emissions from burning coal, gas and petroleum products, and emissions released during chemical reactions in manufacturing plants. While Australia has thousands of industrial facilities, the overwhelming majority of today’s industrial emissions are from 194 large facilities covered by the safeguard mechanism. The report recommended transforming the safeguard. It said companies should be set emissions limits – known as baselines – that reflected their current pollution, not inflated estimates of what it could be, and the baselines should be reduced over time consistent with emissions targets. It said there should be no exemptions and any new facilities should be given baselines substantially lower than the current industry average. Companies should be financially rewarded for emitting below their baseline, but only if the baseline was challenging to meet based on current output, it said. Taylor said in a statement on Sunday that the King review had recommended the government establish a system in which companies could receive carbon credits for emissions cuts below their baseline, and it would now start consultation with industry on how to best implement it and “maximise co-investment”. The Grattan report also recommended the creation of a transformation future fund to offer loans for the replacement of industrial assets with low-emissions alternatives. The fund could be similar to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, but would not be required to earn a return on loans and would draw on both government and private-sector money. For small and medium-sized industrial facilities, it suggested expanding and coordinating existing state energy efficiency schemes, and encouraging use of instant asset write-off to replace older polluting technology with newer and cleaner versions. Wood said reaching net zero would require an “unprecedented pace of asset replacement and renewal, starting now”. The Grattan report said there was significant economic opportunity for Australian industry if the country acted to expand the export of minerals critical in low-emissions technology. If the country maintained its current global market share, exports of copper, nickel, lithium, graphite and cobalt would by 2050 bring in double the revenue earned today through coal exports. The Grattan Institute report is one of five the organisation is publishing before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. A report on transport emissions in July recommended phasing out sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035 if Australia was to have any chance of reaching net zero by 2050. It said it could be achieved by gradually tightening a new emissions limit imposed on light vehicles, and suggesting getting rid of stamp duty for electric cars would cut their price by 6.5%. Like industrial emissions, transport emissions have risen significantly since 2005, the benchmark year against which the Morrison government has pledged to cut emissions.",2

The prime minister told the Business Council of Australia on Wednesday afternoon the government welcomed Woodside’s decision on Monday to green light the $16.2bn Scarborough gas development – a project that has been labelled a “disaster” by environmentalists. “I did a bit of a jig out of the chamber the other day when minister [Keith] Pitt came up and confirmed to me that had taken place and Richard [Goyder, chairman of Woodside,] had been in contact,” the prime minister said. “I just could not be more thrilled about that. It is such a shot in the arm for the economy and it will power us into the future, and it is an enormous vote of confidence about what is happening here in Australia.” The comments came in a section of the speech in which Morrison declared Australia needed to secure its place in the new energy economy, including positioning the nation “to become a world-leading producer and exporter of hydrogen”. But the prime minister assured business leaders while the government was pursuing new technologies to help Australia meet its new net zero by 2050 emissions reduction target – a commitment the prime minister outlined before the Cop26 in Glasgow – “of course we are not walking away from our established strengths”, meaning gas exports. Woodside said the project would be a source of low-carbon gas, but the Conservation Council of Western Australia said it represented the most polluting fossil fuel development in recent memory. The International Energy Agency said in May that limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop this year.

 Morrison’s observation came as Mathias Cormann, Australia’s former finance minister who now serves as OECD secretarygeneral, told a foreign policy thinktank that all countries needed to be “more ambitious” on climate action. Addressing a Lowy Institute event, Cormann said he had attended Cop26 earlier this month “where the need to accelerate global policy action to match climate commitments was obviously very stark”. But when asked whether Australia should have taken a more ambitious 2030 target to Glasgow, Cormann avoided directly criticising the Coalition government, saying it was important “to have credible and realistic transitions” to net zero by 2050. “I think it’s always important to be more ambitious, but it’s even more important to be able to deliver the outcomes,” Cormann said as he delivered the Lowy Institute’s Owen Harries Lecture. “And the outcome that we need the world to deliver is global netzero by 2050. And in that sense, we’ve got to continue to make decisions that help reduce the global problem, that don’t just shift the problem from one jurisdiction to other jurisdictions around the world.” The EU has proposed carbon border adjustment charges in a bid to avoid “carbon leakage”, whereby emissions-intensive industry moves to countries with less stringent climate policies. Those sorts of tariffs have been strongly opposed by the Australian government, which has branded the EU proposal as a “new form of protectionism”. But Cormann appeared to sympathise with the rationale behind EU-style border adjustments. He said the OECD’s push for greater transparency about carbon pricing “would complement, not substitute, for other initiatives to address the risk of trade distortions and carbon leakage from the lifting of ambition in individual jurisdictions”. “The challenge is to ensure the level of ambition and effort in individual jurisdictions can be lifted to the level required while maintaining a global level playing field, avoiding counterproductive trade distortions, and carbon leakage,” he said. Cormann - who as a member of the Abbott government helped abolish the Gillard government’s carbon pricing scheme - also called for an “internationally more coherent and globally better coordinated approach to the pricing of emissions”. He gave a nod to broader structural reform. “It’s also important to remember that securing the transition to netzero emissions is not a job for climate policies alone. We need a carefully sequenced and coordinated fiscal, financial and structural reform package with the whole spectrum of public policy kicking in the same direction.”",2

The energy initiatives are among 44 new infrastructure proposals on the priority list, released on Friday, which together represent a $59bn pipeline of potential investments. A number of projects on the list – which has been significantly influenced by the country’s changing needs since the Covid-19 pandemic – emphasise the importance of digitisation, decentralisation, localism, service innovation and adaptability. They include enabling digital health services for regional and remote Australia and regional telecommunications transmission capacity, listed as high priority national initiatives. The Infrastructure Australia report said the national energy market (Nem) would require “significant new grid-scale, renewable energy generators to replace retiring thermal generation facilities”. It called for the expansion of existing renewable energy zones or the establishment of new zones for large-scale wind, solar and hydro. The Nem required “significant investments in dispatchable energy storage to support growing renewable energy generation and the future retirement of coal-fired generators”, Infrastructure Australia said. Dispatchable energy is power that can be dispatched on demand at the request of power grid operators, according to market needs. Infrastructure Australia cited the Australian Energy Market Operator, which called for 26 gigawatts of new grid-scale renewables and 6–19 gigawatts of new dispatchable storage by 2040. “Introduction of new firming capacity will complement variable renewable energy sources and support the transition to the new electricity mix. “However, without sufficient dispatchable capacity, there is a risk of power outages and load shedding in the Nem.” Infrastructure Australia said potential options included distributed batteries, large-scale battery storage systems, and utility-scale pumped hydro. Infrastructure Australia also listed the Beetaloo Basin as a high priority in the long term – 10 to 15 years – due to the “significant quantity of gas that could be within economically feasible depths to extract”. But its future would “depend largely on extraction costs, environmental impacts, and global trends and policies that impact the role of natural gas in the energy mix in Australia and overseas”. In the near term – within the next five years – Infrastructure Australia listed hydrogen infrastructure as a priority due to “growing interest in the production and use of green hydrogen as an energy source, as it produces no carbon emissions”. Infrastructure Australia chief executive, Romilly Madew, told Guardian Australia that when it consulted stakeholders in mid-2020 it was “clear that infrastructure needs were changing due to Covid and it was really important to respond to that”. Enabling digital health services for regional and remote Australia was listed as a high priority in the near term as Covid-19 had “accelerated the need for telehealth services”, the report said. “By November 2020, more than 3.2m regional and remote Australians had accessed telehealth services.” Infrastructure Australia warned there was a “growing ‘digital divide’ between well-connected and poorly-connected areas of Australia”. “While there have been some improvements in market competition, many regional areas still face these issues and may not have access to future technologies such as 5G.” Madew noted her agency had also released a report on which Covid trends were set to last, and found the trends to digitisation and telehealth were permanent. By contrast, the reduction in public transport patronage was judged to be a “temporary bump”, offering a chance to catch up on maintenance. Madew said the pause in net overseas migration also shifted the priority list towards upgrading existing infrastructure, through maintenance, improved connectivity and safety. She cited the Parkes bypass from Melbourne to Brisbane as one such priority. Of the new 44 priorities, five were port projects reflecting the need to “develop export gateways” and the importance ports had played in maintaining freight during Covid, she said. Level crossing removals in south-east Queensland, Adelaide and Perth were also listed, reflecting the Victorian government’s success with removals in Melbourne. Across the country, other high priorities include: New South Wales – greater Sydney water security, digital infrastructure at Western Parkland City, social housing, Parramatta outer ring-road capacity, and the western Sydney freight line and intermodal terminal Queensland – south-east Queensland level crossings congestion and safety South Australia – Adelaide’s outer ring route capacity, and road maintenance to reduce congestion Northern Territory – enabling infrastructure for developing the Beetaloo Sub-Basin for potential gas market opportunities National initiatives listed as a “priority” include Melbourne to Adelaide freight rail improvements and road access on the Outback Way. In its 2020 list, Infrastructure Australia nominated environmental concerns including rising sea levels, water security and waste management as among its top priorities.",22

Instead of running on “bunker” fuel – the gunky, tar-like substance left behind after oil is refined – Maersk plans to power these ships on carbon-neutral methanol, a colorless liquid made from biomass such as agricultural waste or by combining renewably generated hydrogen with carbon dioxide. Globally, very little of this “green” methanol is produced today and compared with the oil industry waste product most ships run on, the cost is high. Maersk hasn’t yet announced a fuel supply for its new fleet but the company hopes that standing up the world’s first green methanol-powered fleet will spur the energy sector to significantly ramp up production of clean fuels. “Rather than talking about how this can’t be done, let’s just get started and let’s start scaling,” said Morten Bo-Christiansen, the head of decarbonization at Maersk. It’s a small step toward the enormous goal of decarbonizing shipping, an industry that accounts for roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is far off track from meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement. Until now, shipping companies, which operate in remote international waters far from the public eye, have managed to avoid meaningful climate regulation. But the industry is facing a reckoning. The US, the EU and other big economies are starting to make pledges and draw up plans to green the shipping sector and at Cop26, a coalition of countries including the UK and the US signed a declaration committing to “strengthen global efforts” to reach net zero by 2050. Business leaders are starting to take note. “Our crews see this as the number one thing on their boardroom agenda now,” said Guy Platten, the secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, a trade association that represents roughly 80% of the world’s merchant fleet. The shipping industry is a critical pillar of the global economy, with about 90% of all globally traded goods – from oil and steel to furniture and iPhones – ferried around the world by sea. In order to move all those goods, merchant ships burn approximately 300m metric tons of dirty fossil fuels each year, emitting roughly 1bn metric tons of carbon dioxide in the process. That is roughly equivalent to the annual carbon emissions of Japan. The shipping industry will have to eliminate those carbon emissions by 2050 in order to stay in line with the Paris climate agreement’s 1.5C global heating target. But between 2012 and 2018, its emissions rose by 10%. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN body that regulates shipping, predicts that by 2050, the industry’s emissions could be 30% higher than they were in 2008. For that to change, tougher regulations are needed. The IMO adopted an initial energy efficiency regulation for ships in 2011, which set minimum fuel efficiency requirements per mile traveled and another one this June aimed at reducing the carbon intensity of ships by 40% by 2030. Those standards have “basically codified a business as usual trend”, says Faïg Abbasov, the shipping program director at the Belgium-based non-profit Transport & Environment. The June measure requires shipping companies to give their vessels an A-E grade on energy efficiency and submit a “corrective action plan” for any ships that receive a D or E for three consecutive years. But the scores will not be made public and no mechanism exists to force dirty ships to improve, said Abbasov. In 2018, the IMO set a goal of cutting the industry’s carbon pollution at least in half by 2050. But it hasn’t adopted any binding emissions reduction targets or regulations to achieve the target and even if it did, the goal is still far short of what’s needed to remain in line with the Paris agreement. Industry observers ascribe this partly to the slow nature of rule-making at the IMO, but also to corporate influence at the UN agency, where industry representatives are frequently appointed to serve on state delegations. “There’s very little doubt” the shipping industry has stalled IMO climate regulations, said Aoife O’Leary, the CEO of Opportunity Green, a non-profit focused on international climate issues including shipping. But change appears to be on the horizon. The EU is now moving to regulate shipping emissions under its emissions trading system, with a phase-in beginning in 2023. Under the proposed law, by 2026 shipping companies will need to pay for the carbon they emit traveling to and from the EU and between EU ports. Separately, the EU is proposing a fuel mandate that would compel the industry to use a progressively greater share of low- and zero-carbon fuels in its ships. And in April, the US committed to pursuing a zero emissions shipping industry by 2050. While the shipping industry has pushed back against the idea of a patchwork of climate regulations across different nations, O’Leary said these could compel the IMO to take more ambitious action. “If you look at the history of IMO regulations, they’ve often acted because the EU or the US have acted on their own,” she said. The industry does seem more eager to talk about climate. In March, the International Chamber of Shipping proposed a carbon levy of $2 a metric ton of fuel to go towards research and development of clean shipping technology. This proposal, along with a far more ambitious proposal by the Marshall Islands to tax merchant vessels to the tune of $100 a metric ton of bunker fuel, will be discussed at an IMO meeting in late November. Platten of the International Chamber of Shipping wouldn’t say whether the industry would support the specific fuel tax proposed by the Marshall Islands. But he said that shipping businesses “welcome the discussion and debate of market-based measures” to drive down emissions and make low and zero carbon synthetic fuels more economically viable. In October, the ICS called for next zero emissions for the industry by 2050, doubling the ambitions of the IMO. Transforming the shipping sector means zero-carbon fuels must become available on a commercial scale, along with the infrastructure required to pump them into ships. Green methanol, ammonia and hydrogen can all be made with renewable energy, in processes that start with splitting water in an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen. But while green methanol can be dropped into existing ships with fairly minimal retrofits, the other two will require significant modifications of ship designs and operational procedures. Ammonia and hydrogen are gases at room temperature and will need refrigerated tanks to store as liquids. Ammonia is also toxic to marine life and humans, raising safety and environmental concerns. Hydrogen, meanwhile, has a very low energy density compared with oil, which means that ships using it would have to carry much larger volumes of fuel, or be refilled far more often. Proving that alternative fuels are safe and reliable to use on commercial vessels, then scaling them up and deploying them across the global shipping industry will be an expensive and time-consuming endeavor. “What we are really looking at is decades of investment and innovation ahead of us,” said Bo Cerup-Simonsen, the CEO of the Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, a research and development center. “It’s fair to say that we’re talking billions,” he said, “but I think the trillions come when we start to scale this up to become industry wide.” Researchers have estimated that if zero emissions fuels comprise 5% of the international shipping fuel mix by 2030, the industry will be on a path to fully decarbonize by 2050. The Global Maritime Forum’s Getting to Zero Coalition believes that target is achievable based on recently announced plans, including the EU’s 2020 Hydrogen Strategy, which calls for building at least 40 gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2030, as well as China and Japan’s goals to ramp up hydrogen fuel production. While the task ahead is daunting, Cerup-Simonsen is optimistic. The number of large companies expressing interest in carbon-free shipping is growing “day by day”, he said, as is interest from their customers. “You’re seeing mining companies, some of the big retailers, big auto manufacturers starting to demand a greening of their supply chains, including shipping,” Cerup-Simonsen said. Large consumer-facing businesses could be key in helping to drive change in the shipping industry, says Madeline Rose, the climate campaign director at Pacific Environment who recently led a report on the shipping pollution associated with 15 major retail brands, including Amazon, Walmart and Target. In 2019 alone, the report found that these companies were responsible for three coal fired power plants’ worth of carbon pollution through their US shipping imports. Despite making ambitious climate pledges in recent years, most of the companies highlighted in the report do not appear to account for marine pollution in their corporate emissions reporting. Amazon, along with companies including Ikea and Unilever, signed a pledge in October to only move goods on ships using zero carbon fuel by 2040. While retailers demanding cleaner shipping could motivate shipping companies to bring new options online faster, Abbasov of Transport & Environment is doubtful that voluntary corporate pledges will drive transformative change. For now, he says, regulations are needed to make alternative fuels more economically attractive and prevent corporate greenwashing. “Once there are regulations, once the technology has become very common, individual companies can take one extra step and go further than the law says,” Abbasov said. “For shipping, we’re not there just yet.”  This article was amended on 15 November 2021 to correct the name of the Getting to Zero Coalition which had been given as the “Getting to Net Zero Coalition” in an earlier version.",8
environment/2021/nov/18/the-forgotten-oil-ads-that-told-us-climate-change-was-nothing,Environment,environment/2021/nov/18/the-forgotten-oil-ads-that-told-us-climate-change-was-nothing,"Since the 1980s, fossil fuel firms have run ads touting climate denial messages – many of which they’d now like us to forget. Here’s our visual guide","Why is meaningful action to avert the climate crisis proving so difficult? It is, at least in part, because of ads. The fossil fuel industry has perpetrated a multi-decade, multibillion dollar disinformation, propaganda and lobbying campaign to delay climate action by confusing the public and policymakers about the climate crisis and its solutions. This has involved a remarkable array of advertisements – with headlines ranging from “Lies they tell our children” to “Oil pumps life” – seeking to convince the public that the climate crisis is not real, not human-made, not serious and not solvable. The campaign continues to this day. As recently as last month, six big oil CEOs were summoned to US Congress to answer for the industry’s history of discrediting climate science – yet they lied under oath about it. In other words, the fossil fuel industry is now misleading the public about its history of misleading the public. We are experts in the history of climate disinformation, and we want to set the record straight. So here, in black and white (and color), is a selection of big oil’s thousands of deceptive climate ads from 1984 to 2021. This isn’t an exhaustive analysis, of which we have published several, but a brief, illustrated history – like the “sizzle reels” that creatives use to highlight their best work – of the 30-plus year evolution of fossil fuel industry propaganda. This is big oil’s PR sizzle reel. Humble Oil (now ExxonMobil) was not self-conscious about the potential environmental impacts of its products in this 1962 advertisement touting “Each day Humble supplies enough energy to melt 7 million tons of glacier!” Life Magazine, 1962 The truth behind the ad: Three years earlier, in 1959, America’s oil bosses had been warned that burning fossil fuels could lead to global heating “sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York”. Their knowledge only grew. A 1979 internal Exxon study warned of “dramatic environmental effects” before 2050. “By the late 1970s”, a former Exxon scientist recently recalled, “global warming was no longer speculative”.’ In 1991, Informed Citizens for the Environment, a front group of coal and utility companies announced that “Doomsday is cancelled” and asked, “Who told you the earth was warming … Chicken Little?” They complained about “weak” evidence, “non-existent” proof, inaccurate climate models and asserted that the physics was “open to debate”. Both ads from the Informed Citizens for the Environment, 1991 The truth behind the ads: Instead of warning the public about global heating or taking action, fossil fuel companies stayed silent as long as they could. In the late 1980s, however, the world woke up to the climate crisis, marking what Exxon called a “critical event”. The fossil fuel industry’s PR apparatus swung into action, implementing a strategy straight out of big tobacco’s playbook: to weaponize science against itself. A 1991 memo by Informed Citizens for the Environment made that strategy explicit: “Reposition global warming as theory (not fact).” Mobil and ExxonMobil ran one of the most comprehensive climate denial campaigns of all time, with a foray in the 1980s, a blitz in the 1990s and continued messaging through the late 2000s. Their climate “advertorials” – advertisements disguised as editorials – appeared in the op-ed page of the New York Times and other newspapers and were part of what scholars have called “the longest, regular (weekly) use of media to influence public and elite opinion in contemporary America”. Left: New York Times, 1984. Right: New York Times, 1993 Between 1996 and 1998, for instance, Mobil ran 12 advertorials timed with the 1997 UN Kyoto negotiations that questioned whether the climate crisis is real and human-made and 10 that downplayed its seriousness. “Reset the alarm,” one ad suggested. “Let’s not rush to a decision at Kyoto … We still don’t know what role man-made greenhouse gases might play in warming the planet.” Left: New York Times, 1997. Right: New York Times, Wall Street Journal and other publications, 2000 The truth behind the ads: “Exxon’s position”, instructed internal strategy memos from 1988-89, was to “extend the science” and “emphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions” about the climate crisis. Or as a 1998 “Action Plan” by Exxon, Chevron, API, utilities companies and others declared: “Victory will be achieved when average citizens” and the “media ‘understands’ (recognizes) uncertainties in climate science”. ExxonMobil continued to fund climate denial through at least 2018. One of their 2004 advertorials claimed “scientific uncertainties” precluded “determinations regarding the human role in recent climate change”. That was untrue. Nine years earlier, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had concluded a “discernible human influence on global climate”. ExxonMobil’s chief climate scientist was a contributing author to the report. “Don’t risk our economic future,” implored the Global Climate Coalition, a front group for utility, oil, coal, mining, railroad and car companies. This 1997 ad also targeted the Kyoto negotiations and was part of a $13m campaign that was so successful that the White House told GCC: President Bush “rejected Kyoto, in part, based on input from you”. Global Climate Coalition, 1997 The truth behind the ad: Put “emphasis on costs/political realities”, instructed a 1989 Exxon strategy memo. Just as the fossil fuel industry funded contrarian scientists to deny climate science, it also touted the flawed economic analyses of industry-funded economists. The best predictors of fossil fuel industry ad spending are media scrutiny and political activity. Today, economic scaremongering has gone digital, with huge spikes in television and social media ad spending by oil lobbies each time climate regulations loom. In the runup to the 2018-20 US midterm and presidential elections, ExxonMobil spent more on political advertising on Facebook and Instagram than any other company in the world (except Facebook itself). From 2004 to 2006, a $100m-plus a year BP marketing campaign “introduced the idea of a ‘carbon footprint’ before it was a common buzzword”, according to the PR agent in charge of the campaign. The targets of this campaign were the “routine human activities” and “lifestyle choices” of “individuals” and the “average American household”. In 2019, BP ran a new “Know your carbon footprint” campaign on social media. Both ads were published in various publications from 2004 to 2006. The truth behind the ads: Big oil’s rhetoric has evolved from outright denial to more subtle forms of propaganda, including shifting responsibility away from companies and on to consumers. This mimics big tobacco’s effort to combat criticism and defend against litigation and regulation by “casting itself as a kind of neutral innocent, buffeted by the forces of consumer demand”. “We’re partnering with major universities to develop the next generation of biofuels,” said Chevron in 2007. This is also a top talking point of BP, ExxonMobil and others. The New Yorker, 2007 ExxonMobil has been trumpeting its research into algae biofuels for more than a decade – from black-and-white print ads (2009) to digital commercials (2018-21). New York Times, 2009 New York Times, 2018 The truth behind the ads: Greenwashing confers companies with an aura of environmental credibility while distracting from their anti-science, anti-clean energy disinformation, lobbying and investments. The goal is to defend what BP calls a company’s “social license to operate”. One way fossil fuel companies give themselves a green sheen is to establish – then boast about – what a 1998 API strategy memo termed “cooperative relationships” with reputable academic institutions. Big oil’s colonization of academia is pervasive. Shell’s ongoing sponsorship of the London Science Museum’s climate exhibition comes with a gagging clause prohibiting the museum from discrediting the company’s reputation. As for algae: America’s five largest oil and gas companies spent $3.6bn on corporate reputation advertising between 1986 and 2015. ExxonMobil has spent more on advertising than on algae research. BP “developed an ‘all of the above’ strategy” for marketing energy from 2006 to 2008, “before any presidential candidates spoke of the same”, according to BP’s PR lead. Big oil continues to promote this narrative of “fossil fuel solution-ism’, including its “all of the above” language, on social media, in Congress and in paid-for, pretend editorials in the Washington Post. To make this spin stick, fossil fuel companies have been calling methane “clean” since at least the 1980s. “Natural gas is already clean,” said API Facebook ads and billboards last year. One of BP’s many ‘all of the above’ ads grouping oil and natural gas with renewable sources American Petroleum Institute native advertising in the Washington Post, 2021 The truth behind the ads: In contradiction to the science of stopping global heating, big oil asserts that fossil fuels will be essential for the foreseeable future. The “all of the above” energy mantra was – as BP’s advertising creative put it – “co-opted by politicians in 2008” and became a centerpiece of the Obama administration’s energy policies. The campaign also positioned methane as a “clean bridge” fuel. Like “clean coal”, calling methane “clean”, “cleanest” or “low-carbon” has been deemed false advertising by regulators. A Shell TV ad last year featured birds in the sky, fields of wind and solar farms, the CEO of a Shell renewables subsidiary saying she’s “made the future far cleaner and far better for our children”, and not one reference to fossil fuels. The truth behind the ad: Between 2010 and 2018, 98.7% of Shell’s investments were in oil and gas. Such misrepresentations are industry-wide. Today, we’re all inundated with ads that leverage a combination of narratives, including those illustrated above, to present fossil fuel companies as climate saviors. It’s way past time we called their bluff. The narratives highlighted here are a selection of “discourses of climate denial and delay” previously identified by the authors and other researchers. The advertisements selected to illustrate these discourses were identified by the authors based on a review of dozens of peer-reviewed studies, journalistic investigations, white papers, ad libraries, newspaper archives, social media reports and lawsuits.",1

To achieve this, not only must the emissions released by countries and companies be dramatically curtailed, but billions of tons of carbon dioxide must be sucked out of the atmosphere. These findings directly informed Microsoft’s climate policy, said Willmott. In January 2020, the company announced that it would be carbon negative by 2030 and by 2050 it would have removed from the atmosphere all the carbon it has emitted since it was founded in 1975. By making this pledge, the company joined a small group of businesses, including Ikea and the software company Intuit, committed to going further than net-zero. Microsoft is often ranked as a leading business on climate action. Its policies – from making it easier for people to repair their devices to launching software to help companies measure and manage carbon emissions – have been praised for going beyond the company’s own operations to the footprint of its suppliers and customers. “Being a large, well-known brand, and putting a stake in the ground, talking publicly for years about the importance of climate change, is really critical,” said Simon Fischweicher, head of corporations and supply chains for the environmental non-profit CDP North America. However, Microsoft has also been criticized for actions that appear to contradict its bold rhetoric on climate, including membership of trade associations that lobby against climate legislation, contracts with oil and gas firms and donations to politicians who obstruct climate policy. These connections make it “complicit” in efforts to push against climate action, said Bill Weihl, a former sustainability executive at Google and Facebook and the founder of the advocacy group ClimateVoice. Microsoft has been operating as a carbon-neutral company for nearly a decade, a feat it has achieved through buying carbon offsets as well as securing renewable power directly from clean energy companies and installing onsite renewable energy, such as solar panels at its offices. Since 2012, Microsoft has also implemented an internal carbon fee, currently set at $15 a metric ton, making business units pay for emissions related to their operations and electricity, as well as from business air travel. “The money gets collected and spent,” said Willmott, whose carbon management team uses the money to fund initiatives such as buying clean energy and carbon offsets. “I have to pinch myself regularly because that was something we dreamed about and didn’t think was actually going to happen.” It’s a “powerful mechanism”, says Fischweicher, to push a company to think more deeply about the impact of its activities: “To pay a fee, you start to think about: ‘What can I do to reduce that so I have more money in my budget?’” But the company has recognized that much more is required to tackle the climate crisis and the plan to go carbon negative was a big step up in ambitions. Microsoft has laid out milestones for reaching the target. By 2025, it aims to reduce the emissions from its direct operations to “near zero” through gains in energy efficiency and using 100% renewable energy. By 2030, it has committed to reducing by at least 50% its direct emissions and those from its supply chain. The company’s supply chain – more than 58,000 suppliers provide everything from office furniture to the metals and plastics used in its products – makes up the bulk of its emissions. Last year, the company implemented a carbon reporting requirement for suppliers and it extended the internal carbon fee to cover supply chain emissions. But in order to remove more emissions than it produces, the company will rely heavily on carbon removal projects. These include nature-based initiatives such as funding reforestation projects, but the company is also pinning its hopes on technology. Microsoft is investing $1bn to support emerging technology that can reduce, capture and remove carbon from the air. As part of this, the company has invested in and purchased carbon removal from Climeworks, which operates the world’s largest direct air capture plant, in Iceland, removing CO2 from the air and trapping it in rock underground. In 2020, Microsoft removed 1.3m metric tons of carbon through a range of initiatives from nature based programs to carbon capture technology. However, these projects face obstacles. Relying on forests and soil to trap endless amounts of carbon is increasingly difficult in the face of worsening wildfires, pests and changes in land use. And carbon removal technology is not anywhere near the scale needed. There are 19 direct air capture (DAC) plants in operation globally, capturing just over 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. The International Energy Agency has estimated that reaching net zero by 2050 would require the world to scale up DAC to capture more than 85m tons each year by 2030 and around 980m tons a year by 2050. It’s a challenge that Microsoft is grappling with. The number and type of projects currently available is “far short of what we need”, said Willmott. By 2030, the company estimates, it will need to remove 5m to 6m tons of carbon. This means the technology will need to be considerably scaled up to meet Microsoft’s demands alone, she said, “and that’s to say nothing of the fact that there’s a real spike in corporate demand”. It’s not just the amount of viable carbon capture projects that’s lacking, Willmot said; there’s also a quality issue. The industry doesn’t fully distinguish between avoided emissions and those that are actually removed from the atmosphere, she said. More robust quality standards would go a long way to making sure “it’s not quite a wild, wild west that it is today”, Willmot said. “[Microsoft is] opening up new conversations about historical emissions without having all the answers,” said Aoife Brophy, departmental research lecturer in innovation and enterprise at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School. “Leaders on climate need to acknowledge the complexity of the problem and be transparent about the fact that there are not always clear solutions.” Microsoft’s focus on historical emissions could also help spur a deeper conversation, she said, about “responsibility for the past, and may lead to much better ways to think about issues like climate justice that have not yet been adequately addressed by companies”. The modern corporate sustainability movement requires companies to also consider their impacts on customers, peers and society more broadly. This shift in perspective, said Fischweicher, “is a really critical turning-point moment … because what you’re also talking about is shifting your business model overall”. To Microsoft’s critics, this means the company should reconsider its work with oil companies. The same week that Microsoft made its carbon-negative announcement, it sponsored an oil conference in Saudi Arabia. A 2020 Greenpeace report digging into tech companies’ work with the oil and gas industry – such as providing software to support fossil fuel extraction – found that its contract with ExxonMobil “could lead to emissions greater than 20% of Microsoft’s annual carbon footprint”. The company also spent about $200,000 during the 2020 US election cycle supporting politicians with a history of climate denial. And this October, Microsoft – along with other corporations – was criticized by the watchdog group Accountable.US for its membership of trade organizations with a history of fighting climate crisis legislation, including the Business Roundtable and the US Chamber of Commerce. Most recently, these groups have lobbied against climate legislation included under Joe Biden’s reconciliation bill. “I feel really strongly that we need to be able to work with everyone to make this transition to a low-carbon economy in the future,” said Willmott, responding to these criticisms. “I really think it’s important not to villainize any particular sector, or villainize any particular entities, but rather really work hard from within to shape the journey.” Weihl, whose organization ClimateVoice is calling on Microsoft and others to devote one-fifth of their lobbying dollars to climate policy in 2021, remains skeptical. “Companies are putting their narrow self-interest ahead of actually addressing the climate crisis at scale,” he said. “Silence and unwillingness to publicly distance themselves [from these groups] is not neutrality, it’s complicity.” Whether it’s Microsoft’s customers and affiliations or the type of work it does, experts agree the company’s size and political heft as well as its position within trade groups give it immense power – and it’s all about how the company chooses to use it. “Tech companies shape how we engage with the world, and the information we see on a daily basis,” said Brophy. “We need to think of impact beyond measuring emissions and consider ways in which technology can be used to create change across different systems.” Microsoft’s climate commitments are laudable, she said, but ultimately success will require collective action. “The biggest challenge is that Microsoft’s goals cannot be achieved by Microsoft alone,” said Brophy. “But that’s exactly what we need to see companies across industries doing more of: coming out and being bold, recognizing that they need to be systems leaders.”",5
environment/2021/apr/22/the-worst-electric-vehicle-policy-in-the-world-automotive-coalition-pans-victorias-ev-tax,Environment,environment/2021/apr/22/the-worst-electric-vehicle-policy-in-the-world-automotive-coalition-pans-victorias-ev-tax,"Proposed tax will kill the state’s nascent EV market and make it impossible to meet its own emissions targets, critics say","A coalition of car manufacturers, industry groups, infrastructure companies and environmentalists have branded the Victorian government’s proposed electric vehicle tax the “worst electric vehicle policy in the world”. In an open letter, published as a full-page advertisement in the Age newspaper on Thursday, the group of 25 organisations lashed the state government’s policy. “This new tax means the world’s manufacturers are far less likely to send Victorians their best, most affordable, zero emissions vehicles,” the letter states. “That makes things much harder for Victorian families who want to buy and drive electric.” The signatories include Hyundai, Volkswagen, Uber, Jetcharge, the Clean Energy Council, Solar Citizens, Doctors for the Environment Australia and the Australia Institute. When introducing its plan to make electric vehicle drivers pay by the kilometre, the Victorian state government said it was about ensuring a fair contribution towards paying for road use, because they weren’t paying the fuel excise. The user-pays system will require drivers to keep a logbook of their travels from July that will then be used to calculate a charge of 2.5 cents/km to be paid when they renew their registration. Records will need to be kept for five years and people who fail to produce records may face charges. Critics say introducing the policy when the take-up of electric vehicles in Victoria is currently just 0.7% will kill the market before it has the chance to become established. Michael Bartsch, the managing director of Volkswagen Group Australia, described the proposal as an “anomaly”. “Volkswagen does not ask for incentives to import zero emissions vehicles, rather for the abandonment of such disincentives as this ill-conceived anomaly of a tax,” Bartsch said. Bartsch told the ABC earlier this week that Australia was “a Third World dumping ground in terms of automotive technology” thanks to its lack of sound policy in the area. Behyad Jafari, the chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Council, said if the tax passed parliament it would make Victoria a “national pariah” on electric vehicle policy. “For them the argument is one of political expediency,” Jafari said. “There will come a point where these sorts of charges make sense, but the state government is worried about trying to sell a tax to a large group of people down the track. It will be difficult, they say, so why not sneak it in now and get people used to the idea? “To that we say political expediency shouldn’t get in the way of what you are trying to achieve as a government. If you want to achieve net zero by 2050 you need to have 100% of vehicle sales electric by 2035. That’s just to achieve their own targets. “So they need to be honest. Either they want to achieve that or they don’t.” CO2 emissions from cars on Victoria’s roads have risen by 18.4% since 1990. Replacing every car on the road with an electric vehicle would cut 27m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2046. There also appears to be strong community support for electric vehicles. In early April, the independent advisory body Infrastructure Victoria released the results of a month-long workshop with 211 people which found at least 70% of participants supported ending the sale of cars with petrol engines by 2030. Richie Merzian, the climate and energy program director at the Australian Institute, said the tax showed how a lack of leadership by the federal government was seeing states go it alone and risk undermining the transition to a zero carbon economy. “There’s a real mish-mash in approaches to electric vehicles. You have the ACT, which is waiving stamp duty, that is lowering rego, which is giving out $15,000 no-interest loans and allowing EVs to use bus lanes in some places,” Merzian said. “Then within a few hours’ drive, you’re going to have the opposite. What that means for Victoria is there is far less likelihood that car manufacturers will set up shop, invest or companies will base themselves or launch their products in Victoria. “It also means Victoria will be double dipping when it comes to their fuel excise revenue.” Merzian said it was “somewhat disingenuous” to suggest that roads were funded by the fuel excise because those funds collected by the federal government went towards general revenue. Thanks to the patchwork of inconsistent state and federal policy initiatives, electric vehicles will account for just 18% of all new vehicle sales in Australia in 2030, according to analysts at BloombergNEF. The Senate economics references committee on Thursday will review a private members bill put forward by Victorian Greens senator Janet Rice that proposes Victoria – and any other state that targets electric vehicles with a tax – forfeit GST revenue equal to the money raised by the measure. “This hearing is the first opportunity for public scrutiny of a state EV tax at the federal level, and what the national implications would be if Victoria moves ahead in implementing this backwards policy,” Rice said. “It also reflects both the lack of transparency and concrete national EV plan from the Morrison government. “All other developed countries have clear targets to cut pollution from cars and we are the only OECD country without mandatory fuel-efficiency standards for road passenger vehicles. Governments should be implementing policies that help phase out the internal combustion engine, not putting taxes on their cleaner competitors.”",4

Almost all of the intense heatwaves that have hit Europe since 1950 occurred during my lifetime. It’s likely they will only get worse. Unfortunately, Poland, where I live, has clung to an energy model driven by burning fossil fuels for too long. This irreversible destruction violates our right to life, health, property and values ​​of the natural world. That is why at 17 years old, I decided to take the Polish government to court in June 2021 over its failure to act on the climate crisis. The grim stakes for my generation are undeniable. It has been more than five years since world leaders pledged to limit global warming to 1.5C. Since then, emissions have continued to rise, and according to the International Energy Agency emissions will hit a record high by 2023 if green recovery fails. The newest report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that human-caused emissions have already contributed to irreversible changes in our climate system, and are rapidly moving us toward an uninhabitable planet. What we really need as world leaders gather for the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow is a global system change. A world built on business as usual is clearly falling apart – it has already for the most vulnerable. The world economy is reliant on constant growth and human exploitation in order to create profits. That’s why it is no surprise to see that a country’s rise in emissions correlates with its growth in GDP, energy consumption and pollution. But the capitalist growth model is incompatible with a zero-carbon world. By popularizing concepts such as “green growth” or “green capitalism”, world leaders sentence humanity to a life of dystopia. Ultimately, these proposals are the same concepts that brought us into this crisis in the first place, but in disguise. Activists call it greenwashing for a reason. When high-income nations transition their economies toward “green” solutions, what happens to low-income nations? Will the global north continue to exploit other countries in order to deliver on their climate pledges while also growing their economies? And what about climate reparations for the most affected communities? While leaders of the global north continue to perpetuate the status quo built on the exploitation of others, they deepen the harsh socio-economic conditions in countries that bring them profits. In other words, high-income nations use “growth” as a justification for the torture caused in other territories. Low-income nations are robbed of their ability to address the climate crisis when more immediate issues become a necessary priority, such as feeding their people, securing access to electricity, quality healthcare and education or ending conflict. Climate change worsens these “more pressing” issues, perpetuating the downward cycle even more. The climate crisis may center on the term “climate”, but it may be one of the biggest social crises humanity has ever faced. Hence, climate justice cannot be achieved without addressing and prioritizing social justice in all parts of the globe. I think about the climate crisis and its intersectional connections every single day. I started my activism journey more than two years ago and have called myself a full-time activist since summer 2020. While activism may take a toll on my physical and mental wellbeing, I find it’s the best antidote for climate depression. Utopia quite literally means achieving a perfect imaginary world that doesn’t exist (from Greek ou-topos – no place, nowhere). However, striving toward a near-utopian state is the only chance we have today to save humanity. In today’s world, limiting the global average temperature to 1.5C and achieving climate justice may seem out of reach due to the fundamentals on which the global north has built its societies. However, the miracle happens when one realizes that this system is not inherently this way – it was created. The utopia we dream of is within our reach if we address the colonial, racist and oppressive roots of our current planetary crisis. Communities fighting on the frontlines have already been transforming their radical imagination of a fully liberated world into a reality. Everything has to change, especially our understanding of the impossible.",4

Figures released on Tuesday by the Morrison government showed that on a year to year basis, emissions for the 12 months to last June totalled 498.9m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. That tally was down 2.1%, or 10.8m tonnes compared with the same period a year earlier. However, on a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, emissions increased to 127m tonnes, or just over 2%, from the 124.4m tonnes reported in the March quarter. For the year to March, emissions totalled 494.2m tonnes, underscoring the pickup in pollution in the more recent quarter. A stable pollution rate, if not a rising one, is also implied by the government’s release of preliminary figures for the September quarter. They point to 125m tonnes of emissions in trend terms for the July-September months, bringing the year to September total to about 500m tonnes, the latest report said. The government has made much of Australia “meeting and beating” climate targets. However, the latest statistics show mostly emissions are not in decline despite its pledge ahead of the Glasgow climate summit that the country would hit net zero by 2050. “Nothing’s happening except for the electricity sector,” said Hugh Saddler, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University. Once Covid curbs on the economy eased, such as during the current quarter, emission sources such as from transport will show a rise, he predicted. Falling costs for new wind and solar farms are pushing coal and gas out of electricity generation, as well as pushing down power prices. In seasonally adjusted terms, though, emissions for that sector rose from 39.7m tonnes the March quarter to 41.6m in the June one. Most other sectors were steady, with pollution from transport adding almost 1m tonnes in the June quarter. On an annual basis, a 500m tonnes tally is the lowest since records began in the 1990s. That lower trajectory, though, is lower due much to the land sector remaining a net sink even as some experts raise questions about the true trends when it comes to land clearing. According to the government, this sector – known as land use, land-use change and forestry – amounted to a net reduction of emissions of 24.4m tonnes, or almost negative 5% of the national total, in the year to June. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The magnitude of this net sink has decreased by 0.6% (0.2 Mt CO2-e) on the previous 12 months due to an increase in emissions from agricultural soils, partially offset by a continuing decline in land clearing emissions,” the latest report said. For its part, the government also touted the increase of renewable energy as central to driving emissions lower. “Since 2017, Australia’s consumption of renewable energy has grown at a compound annual rate of 4.6%, with more than $40bn invested in Australia’s renewable energy sector,” Angus Taylor, the federal energy minister said. “Last year, Australia deployed new solar and wind at eight times the global per capita average.” ANU’s Saddler said the main driver had been the 2020 Renewable Energy Target that the Coalition government had cut, and had anyway been implemented “a very considerable time ago”.Tim Baxter, the Climate Council’s senior researcher, said “the time for leaning on the achievements of others is long since past”. “We need a federal government willing to step up on emissions reductions and take charge with real policy, not wishlists,” he said, referring to the government’s net zero plan to rely on technologies to cut pollution, some of which don’t exist now.",0
environment/2020/nov/14/green-giants-the-massive-projects-that-could-make-australia-a-clean-energy-superpower,Environment,environment/2020/nov/14/green-giants-the-massive-projects-that-could-make-australia-a-clean-energy-superpower,The Asian Renewable Energy Hub would have an energy content equivalent to 40% of Australia’s overall electricity generation,"The world’s largest power station is planned for a vast piece of desert about half the size of greater suburban Sydney in Australia’s remote north-west. Called the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, its size is difficult to conceptualise. If built in full, there will be 1,600 giant wind turbines and a 78 sq km array of solar panels a couple of hundred kilometres east of Port Hedland in the Pilbara. This solar-wind hybrid power plant would have a capacity of 26 gigawatts, more than Australia’s entire coal power fleet. The hub’s backers say the daytime sun and nightly winds blowing in from the Indian Ocean are perfectly calibrated to provide a near constant source of emissions-free energy around the clock. Most of it will be used to run 14GW of electrolysers that will convert desalinated seawater into “green hydrogen” – a form of energy that analysts expect to be in increasing demand as a replacement for fossil fuels in the years and decades ahead. Though still five years away from construction, the hub vaulted closer to reality in recent weeks after the federal government granted it major project status – a designation that should smooth the approval processes – and the Western Australian government greenlit its first stage. It is an ambitious undertaking, but it is not alone. The Asian Renewable Energy Hub heads a list of projects and potential developments, many private and some government backed, that are seeking to capitalise on what the economist Ross Garnaut described as Australia’s potential to be a clean energy superpower. While Australia’s climate politics remain stuck in gridlock, the government is focused on promoting gas-fired developments and – Covid-19 aside – national greenhouse gas emissions have largely flatlined in the years since the Coalition abolished an overarching federal climate policy. However, the plummeting cost of solar and wind energy is encouraging investments that seemed unlikely not long ago. The pace of investment in large-scale clean energy has slowed since the 23% national renewable energy target was filled and not replaced last year, but state governments and corporates are filling some of that gap. This week alone there were a string of extraordinary announcements. The New South Wales government plans to underwrite 12GW of renewable energy and 2GW of storage over the next decade, Woolworths is promising to run its supermarkets and operations on 100% green energy within five years, and the country’s biggest super fund, AustralianSuper, dumped its shares in Whitehaven Coal as it set a path to a net-zero emissions investment portfolio by 2050. Perhaps most remarkably, Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest foreshadowed that his Fortescue Metals Group would move aggressively into renewable energy, setting a goal of building 235GW across the globe. Here are some of the other green shoots and big ideas that are on the horizon or, in some cases, already with us. The Pilbara project was initially planned as a means to sell green energy to coal-rich Indonesia via sub-sea cable. That idea has been dropped in favour of hydrogen, based on the expectation that by 2035 the world will be looking for vast amounts of green fuel to replace coal, gas and oil. Alex Hewitt, the founder and director of CWP Renewables, an Australian-based partner in the hub, says the $53bn development is the country’s first “renewable energy project at oil and gas scale” – and a sign of where the world is headed. “The buzzwords here are scale and urgency,” he says. “When fully operational this will produce 1.8m tonnes of hydrogen every year for decades, with an energy content equivalent to 40% of Australia’s overall electricity generation.” All being well, Hewitt says, its first shipment of green energy into Asia will be made in 2027. Hydrogen has grabbed the attention of politicians and industry, including winning support at federal and state level in Australia. There are more than 20 smaller hydrogen projects under way across the country, but the hub dwarfs them. Hewitt says it will allow the fuel to be produced for less than $2 a kilogram, the level at which the Morrison government expects it to be cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. “It’s amazing how fast the transition is coming,” he says. “All the technology we’re using is proven at demonstration level. We have the right backing, we have the partners and it will get done.” The consortium expects 3GW of its solar and wind capacity to be used locally to power mining sites and large trucks, replacing 3bn litres of imported diesel used in the Pilbara each year. Some of the energy may help create new industries such as green steel, which is seen as a significant economic opportunity once coal-fired processes can be affordably replaced with renewables and hydrogen. But most of the energy created will be exported. Because hydrogen condenses from a gas into a liquid only at very low temperatures (about -250C), it will be shipped as green ammonia, which is safer to transport and created by blending hydrogen with nitrogen. While not everyone is as bullish, the consortium believes the applications for green hydrogen and ammonia may be as broad as fossil fuels are today, including heavy road transport, long-range shipping and aviation, fertiliser production, energy-intensive big industry such as mining operations, and electricity generation. On the latter, they are closely watching a Japanese trial using ammonia to co-fire an existing coal power plant. The second of Australia’s two giant renewable export projects is no less extraordinary in its ambition, and also has been granted major project status from the federal government. Like the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, it is billed as the largest of its type in the world. The $22bn Sun Cable proposal, backed by billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Forrest, involves building a 10GW solar farm with battery storage at the Newcastle Waters cattle station about 750km south of Darwin. Some of the electricity may be used to help power the Northern Territory capital and Indigenous settlements, but most would be intended for transmission via sub-sea cables that would snake 3,800kms through the Indonesian archipelago to Singapore. Sun Cable’s chief executive, David Griffin, has said the project could provide up to a fifth of the city-state’s electricity. Long-distance high-voltage direct current submarine cables are used in Europe, but this would be the world’s longest by some distance. The NT government last month announced the project had reached the first stage of the environmental approvals process, and Sun Cable has begun discussions with authorities in both Singapore and Indonesia and surveyed the first 750km of the route. Its goal is to start construction in late 2023 and, like the Pilbara hub, to be exporting by 2027. While onshore wind and solar have boomed in recent years as developers rushed to fill the national renewable energy target, Australia is yet to follow other countries – particularly in northern Europe and Britain – in building turbines off the coast. That may change with a proposal to construct a 2.2GW windfarm in Bass Strait off Port Albert and Mcloughlins Beach in South Gippsland. According to the proponents, the $10bn project would be one of the world’s largest offshore windfarms, and likely to meet about 20% of Victoria’s electricity needs. It would involve a yet-to-be-determined number of turbines – the company just says hundreds – of between 185 and 245 metres being built on the seabed between 7km and 25km offshore. It is potentially a sensitive place to build, with plans needing to factor in the impact on marine life and of grid connections to the Latrobe Valley inland. One of the questions hanging over the project will be its cost, but Star of the South maintains it makes economic sense – that the technology is becoming cheaper and the generation patterns of offshore wind will complement, rather than compete with, onshore renewables. It is seeking environmental approval from the Victorian government and waiting on the commonwealth to complete a legal framework for offshore clean energy developments, but has a goal of starting to generate by 2025. Where offshore wind is in its infancy, batteries are being built at a pace few expected. Just four years ago, the Australian Energy Market Operator forecast that the country might have only 4MW of large-scale batteries by 2020, and build no more before 2036. The reality is a marked contrast. There is already 287MW in operation or committed to construction, including several batteries built alongside wind or solar developments. Last week, the Victorian government announced a contract for a 300MW battery near Geelong – larger than everything built to date and billed as one of the biggest in the world. While batteries are often assumed to be storing surplus energy from the middle of the day for use when the sun goes down, the primary use so far in Australia is to bolster the security of the grid. When something goes wrong — such as a major transmission line being taken out by a tornado or a power station “tripping”, as happens more than 100 times a year — batteries are called on to plug the gap in a fraction of a second to prevent the grid collapsing. Simon Holmes à Court, a senior adviser to the Climate and Energy College at Melbourne University, said they were an attractive option for state governments wanting to strengthen their grids at modest cost. Independent reviews found Australia’s first big battery, built at Hornsdale in South Australia in 2017, saved consumers $150m in its first two years in operation. Expect to see more of them, rapidly. “Falling costs and greater familiarity of the technology have led to solar and wind developers increasingly building batteries into their plans,” Holmes à Court says. Perhaps the Asian Renewable Energy Hub will one day pass it, but for now the biggest power plant in the country is spread across 29% of Australian homes. By the middle of this year, the country had about 12GW of solar rooftop panels, with installations continuing at a pace unaffected by Covid-19 or the gradual winding back of government incentives. Investment in large-scale renewable energy fell this year, but the growth in small-scale solar has increased to fill the gap. It is expected 2.9GW will go up this year, equivalent in capacity to a couple of average-sized coal plants. It has prompted authorities to take steps so panels can be temporarily disconnected from the grid if the influx of solar power causes problems for grid security. The 20th-century electricity system, based on a handful of large generators, was not built to cope with an influx of distributed power. A better solution may be to make it more financially attractive to install household batteries, which if pooled together can operate as a centrally controlled virtual power plant, charging or dispatching energy to the grid as needed. South Australia is trialling this sort of system, but for now incentives are limited in most states. In the meantime, analysts expect the skyrocketing installation rate to continue, reflecting the International Energy Agency’s observation that solar can now offer the cheapest electricity in history.",25

Sharma’s crime? No quarantines, having taken advantage of the rare exemptions offered to ministers, and 200,000 air miles in the pursuit of climate diplomacy. The attacks were “froth, cheap shots and trivialising”, in the words of Tom Burke, veteran government adviser and co-founder of the E3G green thinktank. “Alok Sharma is doing a reasonable job. He needs to see people face to face, it’s the only way to do successful climate diplomacy.” To overseas observers, the furore was almost incomprehensible. “This is absurd criticism,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, now a Washington DC analyst. “Sharma is urgently trying to prevent global climate destabilisation, not taking holidays for pleasure.” The hostile headlines were just the latest in a battle that has made the Cop26 team seem gaffe-prone and bumbling. Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s press spokesperson for the talks, raised eyebrows last week when she admitted she would stick to her diesel car, rather than go electric. She also appeared to suggest people could join the Green party to fight the climate crisis, and well-meaning advice to save resources by not rinsing dishes and freezing leftover bread drew more ridicule. More seriously, diplomatic observers cringed when John Kerry, climate envoy to US President Joe Biden, gave a major speech at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew – to an audience lacking any government top brass. Kerry pointedly heaped praise and bonhomie instead on the Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, in the front row where ministers would normally sit. Yet these missteps are only superficial ripples. The government leaders around the world whose actions and goodwill will determine whether Cop26 succeeds or fails will be looking much deeper. “They want to see if they can trust Boris Johnson,” says Burke. “They want to know if they can do a deal.” Underneath the surface, Cop26 is progressing both much better and much worse than recent antics would suggest. To his credit, Sharma has succeeded in focusing countries on preventing global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the threshold beyond which corals bleach, low-lying islands and coastal areas face inundation, and extreme weather takes hold. That may not seem much of an achievement – the 2015 Paris agreement binds countries to hold temperatures “well below” 2C, with an aspiration to keep to 1.5C – but the difference between 1.5C and 2C is crucial in preventing the world reaching potential “tipping points” that could make the climate emergency move even faster. “Every fraction of a degree matters,” the activist Greta Thunberg has repeatedly said. Another success is that in the past year, most of the world’s major economies and emitters have adopted long-term targets of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 or soon after. This is needed to stop warming exceeding 1.5C. But that is not enough. The climate responds to cumulative carbon dioxide levels, so if countries emit too much before 2050, the 1.5C threshold will be breached anyway. For that reason, it is vital that governments come to Cop26 with national plans – called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – to drastically reduce carbon this decade. While the US, the EU and the UK have set out NDCs, some major economies have not, including China, the world’s biggest producer of carbon dioxide, India, and countries such as Japan, Russia, Australia and Brazil whose plans are inadequate. Sharma’s frantic travel schedule is aimed at forging as wide a coalition as possible, to make the commitment to 1.5C irresistible. The UN talks demand consensus, so every country counts, no matter how small. But while he is jetting to global capitals, his fellow ministers show scant regard for the biggest diplomatic meeting on UK soil since the second world war. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer, insisted on slashing overseas aid, a disastrous signal to developing countries desperate for the rich world to honour a pledge of $100bn a year to help them cut emissions and cope with the extreme weather. Boris Johnson has failed to make an impact, devoting more time at the G7 to rows over sausages than climate diplomacy, while hailing Margaret Thatcher for closing coalmines. And foreign secretary Dominic Raab has been almost silent. At home, the UK’s performance has dismayed green experts: the green homes grant was scrapped; the 2030 deadline for phasing out fossil-fuel cars has been attacked; the net zero strategy, heat and buildings strategy, and hydrogen strategy are all delayed; incentives for electric cars slashed; and ministers appear set on pressing ahead with licensing new oil and gas fields. Rachel Kennerley, international climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, told the Observer: “We’re not idly sleepwalking into climate and ecological breakdown, we’re sprinting into it. We don’t need any more of the prime minister’s half-measures and empty rhetoric. The government must stop pouring support into climate-wrecking projects, by withdrawing $1bn for a gas megaproject in Mozambique and rejecting plans for a new oilfield off the coast of Shetland. Any less, and he’ll be the laughing stock at the UN climate talks.”",5
environment/2021/nov/25/how-high-will-emissions-be-from-woodsides-giant-new-gas-project-in-western-australia,Environment,environment/2021/nov/25/how-high-will-emissions-be-from-woodsides-giant-new-gas-project-in-western-australia,The company argues gas will do more than other sources of energy to help the world reach net zero – but it’s only comparing it with coal,"There’s little doubt greenhouse gas emissions from a new $16bn mega gas project off the Western Australia coast will be enormous after it drills into a vast new reservoir of fossil fuels. But just how high will the emissions be from the Scarborough development – confirmed by Woodside and BHP this week? On Tuesday, Woodside’s chief executive, Meg O’Neill, appeared to confirm estimates from environmental campaigners that the project would release about 1.6bn tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere over its 30-year lifespan. That number is more than triple Australia’s current annual greenhouse gas footprint. More than 90% of those emissions would be generated when the gas is burned, mostly by the project’s customers in Asia. On ABC Radio in Perth, O’Neill was asked what the total direct and indirect emissions would be for the life cycle of the project. “I believe it’s in the order of 1.6bn tonnes,” she said. But this number is almost double what Woodside reported in February last year to the government’s National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. In that report to Nopsema, Woodside said total direct and indirect CO2 emissions over the life of the project would be about 878m tonnes. A spokesperson for Woodside told Temperature Check that O’Neill had “inadvertently repeated the incorrect 1.6bn tonnes figure” from a report from the Conservation Council of WA and The Australia Institute. The correct figure, the spokesperson said, was 880m tonnes. This is still a huge number – almost double Australia’s total annual emissions. So why the discrepancy? According to The Australia Institute’s Mark Ogge, who helped pull the report together, the capacity of the production facilities Woodside will be running is greater than the amount of gas the company has reported it will extract from the Scarborough gasfield. The report projected the emissions if the facilities extracted to their full capacity. A Woodside spokesperson said the claim Scarborough would produce 1.6bn tonnes of CO2 was false and the method to reach the number was flawed. The spokesperson added: “The development of Scarborough does not change Woodside’s net emissions reduction targets and our aspiration to be net zero by 2050 or sooner.” Woodside has come under concerted attack by environmental groups for pursuing the giant gas project at a time when the world needs less fossil fuel, not more. But Woodside is arguing the gas it produces and sells will help the world reach net zero. The International Energy Agency – an influential global advisory group – published a report earlier this year setting out how economies around the world could shift so that greenhouse gas emissions would be at net zero by 2050. O’Neill said the IEA’s net zero 2050 report showed “significant ongoing investments in oil and gas” were needed to meet the world’s energy needs. “Scarborough is just a part of that,” she said. But the IEA’s position comes with some important caveats. In its scenario for reaching net zero, the agency says gas use actually falls by almost 3% a year from 2020 until 2050. The agency says while there will still be about 1,750 billion cubic metres of gas being used by 2050, more than half of this would need to be attached to carbon capture and storage facilities. Woodside has also said gas will help lower emissions because it’s being used in the place of coal in power stations. 
 In its Nopsema report, the company again cited an IEA report that showed that coal-to-gas switching had avoided 100m tonnes of CO2 in 2019. This, argued Woodside, “lends significant credence to the expectation that natural gas, including from sources such as Scarborough, will continue to lead to lower net atmospheric concentrations of GHGs [greenhouse gases] than would otherwise be the case.” But what the IEA said was that the 100m tonnes CO2 reduction had taken place in advanced economies, mostly in the United States where more than 100 coal-fired power plants have converted from burning coal to burning gas in the past decade. When burned in a power plant, gas causes roughly half the emissions of coal. But if gas is being burned to satisfy increasing demand in new power stations, or for heating and cooling, then this is competing with renewables and risks locking in fossil fuel infrastructure for decades. On the ABC, O’Neill said: “What’s important to recognise is how these emissions [from Scarborough gas] would compare [with] other sources of energy.” If those other sources of energy are coal, then O’Neill has a valid point. But the reality is that renewables are cost competitive with fossil fuels and in many cases cheaper. According to Woodside’s own reporting, using Scarborough gas for electricity would emit between 400 and 550 kg of CO2 for every unit of megawatt hour, compared with renewables that are close to zero. As the IEA wrote in a report about switching from coal to gas: “Beating coal on environmental grounds sets a low bar for natural gas, given there are lower-emissions and lower cost alternatives to both fuels. “The falling cost of renewable technologies in the power sector is the clearest case in point. In many power markets, wind and solar PV are already among the cheapest options for new generation, and the role of gas is coming under pressure as a result.” The Guardian has revealed that Queensland Liberal senator Gerard Rennick’s Facebook following has blown out by more than 500% in the last few months following posts about other people claiming severe side-effects from Covid-19 vaccines. Rennick admitted he couldn’t verify the stories and said the testimonials may not be “100% accurate”. While Rennick’s Facebook audience has grown, so have the number of people exposed to the senator’s views on climate science which, in a generous description, might also be described as not 100% accurate. Last month, Rennick told his audience the Earth’s temperature was dictated by the energy output of the sun. Anyone advocating for net zero emissions of greenhouse gases (like, for example, the Morrison government) was pushing “junk science”. What Rennick doesn’t mention is that the amount of energy reaching Earth from the sun has actually been falling since the 1980s, while temperatures keep rising. The extra CO2 accumulating in the atmosphere is the reason why. On Monday, Rennick joined four other Coalition senators to vote for One Nation’s failed attempt at a bill to prevent vaccines being mandated across a swathe of sectors. There’s plenty of antagonism towards climate science among this throng too. One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts claims there is no evidence that human emissions of CO2 can change the climate. South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic has been claiming on Sky News that international climate summits will “aid and abet the deindustrialisation of the west”. In April, Antic said “the left” had changed the term global warming to climate change “when the facts didn’t match the statistics”. Clearly Antic hasn’t heard of Frank Luntz. An influential US Republican pollster, Luntz was advising the energy industry and the GOP in 2000 on how to deal with the climate change issue in the upcoming presidential election that would see George Bush defeat Al Gore. What did Luntz tell the Republicans? It was time to change the language, he wrote, because the term climate change “is less frightening than ‘global warming.’”",2
environment/2021/nov/22/chemicals-industry-pollution-emissions-climate,Environment,environment/2021/nov/22/chemicals-industry-pollution-emissions-climate,While the industry has an important role to play in moving to low-carbon economies it’s also hugely carbon intensive and predicted to become more so,"It’s one of the biggest industries in the world, consumes more than 10% of fossil fuels produced globally and emits an estimated 3.3 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions a year, more than India’s annual emissions – yet the chemicals sector has largely slipped under the radar when it comes to climate. This sprawling industry produces a huge range of products, many of which support other industries – pesticides for agriculture, acids for mining, lubricants for machinery, ingredients in cleaning agents, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and plastics. While the industry has an important role to play in moving to low-carbon economies – providing coatings for solar panels, lightweight plastics to reduce vehicles’ energy consumption and insulating materials for buildings – it’s also hugely carbon intensive and predicted to become more so. Oil companies have been betting on chemicals as a way to remain profitable as the world pledges to turn away from fossil fuel energy. The International Energy Agency predicted that petrochemicals could account for 60% of oil demand in the next decade. The chemicals sector is the largest industrial user of oil and gas but it has the third-largest carbon footprint – behind steel and cement – because only about half of the fossil fuels that the industry consumes are burned for their energy. The rest is used as feedstock for products such as plastics with the emissions released only when these products reach the end of their lives, for example, when waste plastic packaging or an old mattress is incinerated. Lowering the industry’s emissions is possible but technically daunting. Plus this large, complex industry, which supports millions of jobs worldwide, has significant political and economic clout. “They’ve become a bit of an untouchable sector for many politicians,” said Jan-Justus Andreas, who leads industrial policy at the Norwegian environmental non-profit Bellona Europa. Yet the chemicals industry is finding itself increasingly under scrutiny – both from nations that need to meet ambitious emissions reduction targets and from researchers, scientists and campaigners calling on the industry to cut its polluting products. One way to lower emissions is to focus on chemical plants – improving efficiency and switching to low-carbon energy. Most of the industry’s direct carbon dioxide emissions come from burning fossil fuels to power chemical transformations, many of which take place at high temperatures and pressures. These emissions could be significantly reduced if the industry moves away from dirtier fuels such as coal. If renewable wind or solar energy is available, certain chemical processes that are already driven by electricity, such as the production of chlorine used to make other materials such as PVC pipes or solvents like chloroform, could immediately become low carbon. And chemists continue to look for ways to power traditionally heat-driven chemical transformations with electricity instead – such as the process of converting nitrogen to ammonia, mostly used for fertilizer, which requires temperatures of about 500C (932F). While chemical companies are counting on efficiency improvements and investing in renewable energy to meet their climate goals, many chemical products themselves cannot be decarbonized because they are made of carbon, said Martin Scheringer, an environmental chemist at the public research university ETH Zurich. Removing fossil fuels from the raw materials used to create carbon-based chemicals and materials is crucial, said Jonatan Kleimark of the non-profit ChemSec. Kleimark likens products made from fossil fuels – such as clothes, toys and paints – to a carbon debt, because the carbon embedded within them will only be emitted in the future. “The longer we wait to change, the larger debt we will build, and that will be very hard to do something about if we don’t start,” Kleimark said. To stop adding to this debt, chemicals and materials could be made with sources of carbon that are already above ground, such as plants. Bioplastics – made with plant materials such as sugar, corn or seaweed – are booming, for example, as companies and scientists try to remove fossil fuels from plastic production. Another idea is to turn waste products into raw materials for the chemical industry. Chemists have been using agricultural waste or waste plastics – even the ultimate waste material, carbon dioxide – as feedstocks. A Berlin-based startup, Made of Air, is attempting to create plastics from wood waste, while an Icelandic company, Carbon Recycling International, turns captured carbon dioxide emissions into methanol, used in fuels and for making other chemicals such as formaldehyde. But all these ideas – especially those involving a shift in feedstocks – are very hard to implement. Technologies to turn agricultural or plastic waste into new chemicals are still unproven on a large scale and using carbon dioxide as a raw material will require vast amounts of zero-carbon energy. Manufacturers making products with plants rather than fossil fuels need to ensure that they do not create new problems through deforestation, destroying wildlife habitat, raising food prices or increasing the use of water or pesticides. Biomass resources also tend to be more spread out, whereas traditionally, chemical plants stay close to where fossil fuel resources are easily accessible. “With renewable feedstocks, you will need to reestablish new supply chains,” said Zhanyun Wang, a senior scientists at ETH Zurich. In addition to delivering a steady stream of renewable raw materials to chemical plants, the new supply chains would need to be competitive with well-established ones making products from fossil fuels at low prices, Wang said. The clean power infrastructure requirements alone are tremendous. Electrifying Europe’s chemicals sector would require 4,900 terawatts of renewable electricity, according to an estimate by the European Chemical Industry Council, almost double the total amount of electricity Europe generated in 2019. “If you are a lobbyist for the chemical sector, showing those numbers helps you to put your head down again and say, ‘Look, firstly I’m too important and valuable, and secondly, it’s really, really difficult to deal with me, so why don’t you deal with someone else first,’” Andreas said. Currently, that someone else refers to the cement and steel industries, said Andreas. The internal competition between the three industries to avoid scrutiny is unhelpful, he said, because they could benefit from developing an industrial strategy together. The exhaust gases from steel and cement plants could serve as valuable feedstocks for chemical plants. All three industries need large-scale renewable electricity or carbon capture facilities, which require significant investment. The financial risks involved in building these new facilities could be mitigated, Andreas said, if the new facilities serve multiple operations instead of a single steel mill or fertilizer plant. Governments could also help build the necessary infrastructure or help companies gain access to renewable feedstocks, said Rebecca Dell, who directs the industry program at the San Francisco-based ClimateWorks Foundation. But with less than 30 years to 2050, time is short. If there are no delays, typically, it takes about seven years for companies to get a new process up and running, Dell said. “We have to move a lot faster.” One important, but neglected, lever for cutting emissions from the chemical sector is to simply use and produce fewer chemicals. “That would lead very directly to a reduction in CO2 emissions and also reduce the toxification of humans and the environment,” Scheringer said. The overuse of materials such as plastics, fertilizers and other synthetic chemicals has caused devastating effects on ecosystems and human health. Plastic debris chokes waterways and wildlife, fertilizer-laden runoff from fields can cause algal blooms and create dead zones in coastal areas. These impacts have led policymakers and consumers to cut back – for instance, many cities and countries now have prohibitions on some single-use plastics. “It’s an attempt to reduce plastic itself as a pollutant in the landscape, more than concerns about greenhouse gases, but we can make simultaneous progress on more than one front,” said Dell. Studies have also found that being more precise about applying fertilizer could save farmers money and keep greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. It is less straightforward to cut back on some of the chemicals that are used to make consumer products, but Scheringer, Wang and others have proposed a way to start. Alarmed by the dangers of some cancer-causing PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals”, researchers have suggested eliminating PFAS from their “nice-to-have” applications – such as nonstick cookware, long-lasting mascara, or water-repellent surfer shorts that don’t need the level of high performance that “forever chemicals” confer. The researchers recommend that “forever chemicals” be used only in really important products, such as protective gear or medical devices that save lives. The same philosophy could be applied to identify and eliminate other chemicals that have been unnecessarily formulated in products, such as adding antimicrobials to soaps that can already kill germs. Simplifying the chemical ingredients in products has an added benefit: they are easier to take apart or recycle when they are no longer useful. Wang points to the example of carbon black, the chemical used as a pigment in food takeout boxes. The pigment serves no technical function other than providing colour and it is used because food looks more appealing set against a black background, Wang said. But the pigment also means the takeout boxes are invisible to devices that use light to sort plastics at sorting facilities, making them impossible to recycle. The chemical sector is producing more than consumers need, Wang said: “The business model is driven by how many chemicals you sell, it’s not necessarily driven by the added societal value of the chemical.” But the “enormous demand” for products is also a big driver – and perhaps harder to address, said Kleimark. “We’re standing in front of a really, really big challenge because there we cannot rely on technologies, but on changing the way we do things today.”",10
environment/2021/nov/03/the-pm-goes-to-glasgow-or-what-scott-morrison-didnt-do-at-cop26,Environment,environment/2021/nov/03/the-pm-goes-to-glasgow-or-what-scott-morrison-didnt-do-at-cop26,"From a six-year-old emissions commitment to Boris Johnson’s non-binding breakthroughs, Australia’s lack of ambition was on full display","There weren’t many silver linings for Scott Morrison in his extraordinary skirmish with Emmanuel Macron, but one may be that it has distracted public attention from the prime minister’s threadbare performance at the Glasgow climate summit. As Morrison and other leaders flew home from the ongoing talks on Tuesday, observers were tallying up what the prime minister had committed to do at a meeting billed as the best, last chance to deal with the climate crisis. It didn’t take long. Attention then turned to a more significant list: what the Australian government had not committed to doing. At the top was something we have known for a while: it made no commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions rapidly, as scientific advice says is necessary. This was the central point of the Glasgow summit – to ramp up action this decade, as was agreed under the ratchet mechanism of the Paris agreement. Countries are expected to lift their short-term commitments over time on the way to carbon neutrality. The rule of thumb is that global emissions need to be cut roughly in half this decade. That means substantial action from all major emitters, particularly the wealthy. New commitments offered haven’t even come close to that, but they have increased over the past year. The G7 developed nations and the European Union are all promising at least a 40% emissions cut by 2030 compared with (give or take) their highest polluting year. India, the world’s third-biggest emitter, this week promised that half its electricity would be renewable by then. Even China, which drew strong and understandable condemnation from Joe Biden for president Xi Jinping’s non-appearance in Glasgow, offered a meagre increase on its 2030 pledges the week before the summit. Australia didn’t manage that. Morrison went to Glasgow armed with the same short-term emissions reduction target (a 26-28% cut compared with 2005) set under Tony Abbott six years ago. The prime minister was in the awkward position of having to tell the summit in his speech that the country would probably make a 35% emissions cut by 2030 – official government projections said so – but that he would not commit to doing it. Morrison announced some new climate financing to help the least developed and most vulnerable, as wealthy nations have promised. The prime minister described it – and it was reported in some media – as a $2bn commitment. In reality there was only $500m additional funding spread over five years, making the new pledge $100m a year towards an annual global goal of US$100bn. It was significantly less than what many comparable countries have offered. Morrison said Australia would continue to bypass the global Green Climate Fund and fund projects in the Indo-Pacific directly. Beyond that, there were two set-piece pledges by national leaders that drew attention. Australia signed up to one and rejected the other. The “yes” was to a declaration that global deforestation would be halted and reversed by 2030. Officials were slow to confirm Australia supported the initiative. Once they had, the assistant forestry minister, Jonno Duniam, was quick to say it would not require the country to stop native forest logging. The declaration’s main goal is to build support for protecting ecosystems in developing countries where vast areas are being felled for agriculture. The “no’’ was to a global pledge to cut emissions of methane – a short-lived but incredibly potent greenhouse gas – by 30% by 2030. More than 80 countries signed up. Those who didn’t included China, India and Russia. Meeting the methane goal would have required significant action to limit emissions from coalmines and gas fields – something the Morrison government has indicated it isn’t prepared to do. Instead, it muddied the waters, falsely claiming it would have required farmers to shoot their cattle. Unsurprisingly, given its well-documented lack of ambition, Australia is not part of the high ambition coalition, which aims to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – a goal that is supposed to be at the heart of the climate negotiations process. It did sign up to the Glasgow breakthrough agenda, a collection of five goals launched by the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. These goals are technology focused – the Morrison government’s preferred territory – and vaguely defined, but a couple are worth noting. One is that clean power will be the “most affordable and reliable option for all countries” by 2030. The important word here is “clean”, which the Morrison government usually defines as including gas, a fossil fuel. Another is that zero emissions vehicles will become the “new normal” and “accessible, affordable and sustainable” in all regions in 2030. This is clearly at odds with the Coalition’s politically motivated “end the weekend” attack on electric vehicles before the 2019 election, but the government has been gradually inching away from that statement ever since (though not enough to give EV technology the support it receives in other countries). A key point about the “breakthrough” goals is that none are binding, or specific enough to demand new policies. No one has to do anything. Sound familiar? As the emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor put it on Tuesday, they “align strongly with Australia’s approach”.",2
environment/2021/may/29/its-like-a-rocket-ship-videos-show-petrolheads-behind-the-wheel-of-an-electric-car,Environment,environment/2021/may/29/its-like-a-rocket-ship-videos-show-petrolheads-behind-the-wheel-of-an-electric-car,"An Australian engineer-turned climate activist hosts Coal Miners Driving Teslas, a YouTube and Twitter channel heavily spiced with unbridled swearing","What happens when you take an electric car into a town full of petrolheads and coalminers, and film them planting their steel-capped boots on the accelerator? “Fuck me … it’s like a rocket ship,” says one miner, who usually spends his time driving V8s or manoeuvring a giant coal scoop. YouTube and Twitter channel Coal Miners Driving Teslas is the project of 39-year-old mechanical engineer-turned climate change activist Daniel Bleakley. Other reactions – heavily spiced with unbridled swearing – range from “it’s like taking off in an aeroplane”, to three cowboy-style “yee haws” from the veteran independent Australian federal MP Bob Katter. Bleakley owns a performance version of the Tesla Model 3 that can go from zero to 100km/h in about 3.3 seconds (0-60mph in 3.1s). For non-car enthusiasts, Bleakley’s Model 3 will leave most production Porsches and BMWs in its wake. The Model 3 is considered Tesla’s entry-level vehicle, costing between $65,000 and $90,000 new. The location for most of Bleakley’s videos is the coal town of Clermont in regional Queensland, where he grew up and where his parents and brother live. The people he lets drive his car mostly work in the mines and drive powerful petrol cars and utility pick-up trucks. But Bleakley wants to convert them, and sees the power in showcasing their unexpected amazement at the technology. It is safe to say, Clermont is not the sort of place you would find enthusiastic backing for electric cars, which in Australia have been politicised as a cause célèbre of environmentalists. “People up here love cars,” he says. “My mate is a massive petrolhead and he has rebuilt V8s. All his family love cars. When they sit in the Tesla they are completely blown away.” Bleakley has worked in the oil industry in Scotland and in mining in Western Australia, but now lives in Melbourne where he ran a printing business. But he has always been worried about the climate crisis. “I thought it was a future problem. But in the last few years I’ve realised it’s here and now, and we have to act.” Two years ago he decided to focus full-time on climate change and environmental activism. In 2019, he glued his hand to the window of a Siemens office in Melbourne over the technology company’s contract to provide technology to a rail line for the controversial Adani coalmine. The mine is close to his hometown. But seeing his friends go crazy in an electric car “has been a real eye opener”. “Traditional activism is about saying stop, or saying no,” he says. “But this is saying: ‘here’s an incredible space ship from the future and you can drive it’. It’s a future we can all have if we choose it.” Last week Bleakley took a 375km drive from Clermont to Charters Towers on a single charge to meet the inimitable Katter – a silver-haired independent MP whose Kennedy electorate covers more more than 500,000 sq km – an area slightly bigger than Spain. (Bleakley arrived with only 13km left in the battery and had to sleep overnight with his motel room door open to run an extension cable to charge the car.) “Yee haw,” screamed Katter three times as the car’s instant torque pinned the 76-year-old to his seat. “That’s so exciting – it’s so thrilling.” Is Katter converted? Not entirely. He tells the Guardian he thought the car was “a bit small” and while the acceleration was “fantastic” he insisted the big drawback was that it takes “two and a half hours” to charge (charging times actually depend on the battery, the car, and the charging station but modern chargers can add 175km of range or more in about 10 minutes). That said, Katter wants to see an Australia-based electric vehicle and battery industry, and is working with other independents on a fuel security bill that will include his ideas – alongside securing oil supplies and increasing renewable liquid fuels. What became Bleakley’s first video was actually taken by his brother, who had borrowed the car and filmed a workmate driving it. But his favourite is a video of a childhood friend and “Clermont’s biggest car nut” who says on camera it is “like a rocket ship”. “I’ve known him since I was a kid. He owns these incredible high-performance V8s. To see him drive the Tesla and love the car for me was really special. That was when I realised I was really onto something,” Bleakley says. Australia is lagging well behind other developed countries for electric vehicle take-up. The EV industry in Australia – which constituted just 0.6% of new car sales in 2019 – blames a total lack of federal government support. In 2019 the prime minister, Scott Morrison, claimed the opposition’s pro-electric vehicles policy would “end the weekend” for Australians who loved to tow a trailer or a boat, or go camping. Last week, Ford in the US launched a full-electric version of its market-leading F150 truck (it can tow 10,000lb or 4.5 tonnes, according to Ford). EV manufacturers have said Australia’s lack of policies to encourage sales means the country is missing out on an ever-increasing range of vehicles, as manufacturers target more welcoming markets. Bleakley says he’d like to get Scott Morrison into his car, but thinks the chances are unlikely. So next on his radar is the independent Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie. “She’s a real person and she represents her people,” Bleakley says. “I want to see her do a quarter mile on a drag strip. I want to see her feeling it.”",1

All we needed was a worldwide pandemic. Simple. The lack of activity last year meant our emissions excluding land use fell to 2004 levels. But while it is good that the pandemic is more under control than it was last year, what this inevitably means is that emissions will again rise. And we know this because this week also came the news that Australia’s GDP is growing solidly. The sad state of affairs is that, since the end of the carbon price, much that is good for GDP growth is bad for reducing our emissions, and conversely among the things in the GDP figures that were “bad” were good for our task of cutting emissions. Australian households in the past 12 months spent a stunning $26bn less on transport services than we did in the 12 months to March 2020. Because household spending is a key driver of economic growth that meant our lack of spending on transport cut the national economy by around 1%. And because there is almost a perfect correlation between the amount spent on transport services and transport emissions, this also meant in the 2020 emissions produced from transport fell 12%. Before the pandemic the only time annual transport emissions had fallen was in 2013 when they went down a mere 0.9%. So massive was the fall that although the transport sector only makes up 18% of all emissions, it accounted for almost half of the entire drop in emissions last year. But we can expect those emissions to start rising back to pre-pandemic levels – indeed in the last three months of last year quarterly transport emissions rose 3.3% – the biggest jump ever recorded. Graph not displaying properly? Click here The pandemic has been a horrible event and yet within it lies opportunity – emissions have fallen at a rate we need them to keep falling, and the hit to the economy means there is a massive need for government investment. It is the perfect moment to go big investing in the infrastructure that will drive the change to electric vehicles and renewable energy. And yet, it looks to be a lost opportunity. There is no shift towards electric vehicles from the Morrison government, the Victorian government has decided to tax electric vehicles, and, as the Australia Institute’s Richard Denniss has noted, the recent budget provided nothing to encourage EV take-up. The Morrison government wants to build a gas-fired power plant while rejecting recommendations to fund a wind-farm and battery project in North Queensland. Scott Morrison still refuses to even commit to a target year for reaching net-zero and is thumbing his nose at the rest of the world even while the threats of carbon tariffs continue to be raised. Daniel Hurst reported that Morrison has said Australia will take “the Frank Sinatra approach” to climate policy. “We’re going to do it our way in Australia, the Australian way.” That’s fine, but doing it our way implies actually doing something. And we are not. To get to net-zero emissions by 2050 we need to cut emissions by around 34% from 2020 levels in the next decade. We’re on pace to cut them by 4%. The problem of this week isn’t that GDP is unimportant, it is that for now it gets much more attention and focus than do emissions. The political cost of low GDP growth is much greater than is barely falling or rising emissions. And there is no political cost at all about doing nothing to decouple GDP and emissions growth. As we saw this week with its laggard moves to provide assistance to Victorians, and its farcical efforts to keep to commitments to vaccinate those in aged care facilities, the Morrison government resists doing anything and then will only do the bare minimum it thinks needs to be done to get past any political problem. Until reducing emissions becomes a political problem, we cannot expect the Liberal party to do anything.",6
environment/2021/oct/09/fossil-fuel-companies-law-firms,Environment,environment/2021/oct/09/fossil-fuel-companies-law-firms,"Over the last five years, the 100 top law firms in the US represented fossil fuel clients in 358 legal cases and transactions worth $1.36tn","The world’s biggest corporate law firms have been making millions of dollars representing fossil fuel companies but, as the climate crisis intensifies, this work is coming under increasing scrutiny. Over the last five years, the 100 top ranked law firms in the US facilitated $1.36tn of fossil fuel transactions, represented fossil fuel clients in 358 legal cases and received $35m in compensation for their work to assist fossil fuel industry lobbying, according to a “climate scorecard” published in August. The scale of law firms’ work for the fossil fuel industry is huge, said Tim Herschel-Burns, a third year student at Yale Law School and co-founder of Law Students for Climate Accountability, which developed the scorecard. “As we started digging we realised how holistic this is. Everything fossil fuel companies want to do, they need lawyers to accomplish.” Fossil fuel companies rely heavily on armies of lawyers to advise on projects, lobby, negotiate contracts, secure permits and navigate an increasing number of climate lawsuits. Law firms’ fossil fuel industry work has increased compared with the previous year’s scorecard, even as climate warnings become more dire and the International Energy Agency has warned new fossil fuel development is incompatible with the target of net zero emissions by 2050. The climate scorecard awarded firms grades based on their involvement in lawsuits “exacerbating climate change”, their support for fossil fuel transactions and fees received for lobbying on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. Paul Weiss, a top 10 US firm according to Vault Law’s rankings, was one of 37 to receive the lowest F grade. The firm, which has its own sustainability practice, has acted for fossil fuel companies in 30 cases over the last five years, according to the scorecard. Among the most high-profile was the firm’s work representing ExxonMobil in a landmark trial where the company was accused of having misled investors about the risks of climate change to its business. The court ruled in favour of Exxon in 2019. Paul Weiss did not respond to a request for comment. Only 12 law firms were rated an A or B in the scorecard, which meant they did not conduct work for fossil fuel clients. Three firms – Cooley; Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati; and Schulte Roth & Zabel – have actively addressed the climate crisis through renewable energy transactions, lobbying or pro-climate litigation, according to the scorecard report. “We definitely agree that the law can be this force for good,” said Herschel-Burns. “But one thing that we found really striking is that overwhelmingly the top law firms are [representing] the wrong side of it.” There’s a tangible human cost, said Alyssa Johl, legal director for the Center for Climate Integrity. “Elite law firms are representing the oil and gas companies and providing them with a deep bench of high-priced lawyers,” she said. “For the communities across the country that are seeking justice, the end result is that their cases have been delayed and bogged down by procedural hurdles put forward by some of the biggest law firms in the country.” Law Students for Climate Accountability is calling on law firms to pledge to stop taking on new fossil fuel industry work, phase out their current work by 2025 and ramp up their work for the renewable energy industry and in support of litigation to tackle the climate crisis. It’s a potentially controversial stance given the principle that everyone should have access to legal representation. But Herschel-Burns said this principle is often used in “really sloppy ways which end up justifying law firms being able to represent whoever pays the most”. Some firms have acknowledged a choice. Speaking at a conference last year about the link between law and climate change, the global senior partner at Clifford Chance Jeroen Ouwehand said firms “can choose what we support, and what we don’t support. We do not have to be neutral professional service providers”. Law firms are starting to ramp up their own climate action, even as they continue their fossil fuel work. A number of firms that scored F grades on the climate scorecard, including Shearman & Sterling and Hogan Lovells, have signed up to the Net Zero Lawyers Alliance, which launched in July. Members pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and to work with clients to embed climate goals and to help drive “systemic change”. Neither firm responded to the Guardian’s request for comment. Another alliance member, DLA Piper, has set its own science-based target to halve all emissions by 2030, including indirect emissions from the firm’s supply chain. The firm was recently appointed official legal services provider for the forthcoming Cop26 climate talks. But it scored only a D on the climate scorecard and has represented clients including Shell, ExxonMobil and BP. The firm declined to comment. Thom Wetzer, law professor and director of the Oxford Sustainable Law Programme, one of the organisations supporting the alliance, said the firms may be serious about taking steps in the right direction but they do not necessarily have the best practices yet. “We need to move the whole sector, and for many firms involved this is the start of a journey.” Some law firms that ranked low on the climate scorecard were keen to promote their green energy work. Allen & Overy, which according to the scorecard worked on fossil fuel transactions worth $125bn over the last five years, said in a statement that it does “more renewables work than any other law firm in the world by most key measures”. Clifford Chance, which the scorecard calculated worked on fossil fuel transactions worth $123bn, said it is “perennially at or near the top” for advising on renewables financing. But neither firm, both of which scored an F, responded to questions about how they reconcile this work with their representation of fossil fuel firms. Lawyers have a responsibility to reflect on their own role and to ask whether their clients’ values align with their own, Wetzer said. “Firms that engage constructively with the net zero transition will be rewarded; clients will value their judgment and expertise, top talent will be more easily attracted and retained, and these firms will strengthen their social license to operate.” Law firms’ best resource is their employees, said Sam Sankar, of the nonprofit environmental law organization Earthjustice, which makes the climate scorecard a powerful tool. “In the future nobody is going to think twice about making career decisions with an eye to whether it aligns with their climate ethics.” There’s now a conversation about legal ethics and climate which is well overdue, Sankar said. “The [fossil fuel] industry is paying law firms tons of money in an effort to dodge responsibility and block regulatory reforms that could help avert this crisis.”",4
environment/2021/nov/04/gas-new-coal-fossil-fuels-climate-disaster,Environment,environment/2021/nov/04/gas-new-coal-fossil-fuels-climate-disaster,"‘Gas is the new coal’, says Climate Analytics report that finds it the fastest growing source of carbon dioxide emissions","The escalating rollout of gas for heating, electricity and cooking is turning it into the “new coal” and its use worldwide must be slashed by nearly a third this decade to avoid disastrous climate effects, according to a new report. Gas has often been referred to as a “bridge fuel” as it emits about half the carbon dioxide of coal, and many countries have embraced it while also promising to transition to renewable energy in order to cut planet-heating emissions. But this energy source, which has become easy and cheap to access due to the advance of fracking for its extraction, is still a fossil fuel, and the new analysis finds that it is now the fastest-growing source of carbon dioxide emissions, putting the world at risk of blowing past dangerous global heating thresholds. “Natural gas is not a bridging fuel. It is a fossil fuel,” said Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics and lead author of the new report. “Gas is the new coal. Governments, investors and the financial sector must treat it the same way as they do coal: phase it out as soon as possible.” The UK government, which is hosting crucial UN climate talks under way in Glasgow, has vowed to help “consign coal to history”, with the summit producing an agreement signed by more than 40 countries, including major users Indonesia, Vietnam and South Korea, to phase out the carbon-intensive fuel. The focus on eliminating coal comes as countries such as the US and Australia have ramped up their use of supposedly cleaner sources of gas and sought to cash in on a global export market of liquified gas with new infrastructure to ship it around the world. But growth in gas has had a significant influence over global heating, with the Climate Analytics report finding that gas was the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions increase in the past decade, rising by 42% and causing 60% of the methane emissions from fossil fuel production. Methane is a short-lived but potent greenhouse gas that is many times more powerful than CO2 at trapping heat. If the world is to avert disastrous 1.5C of global heating the use of gas should already be in decline, according to the report, but it is projected to cause 70% of the fossil CO2 emissions increase by 2030 under current policies. This means unabated gas use must peak this decade and then drop sharply, the analysis finds, necessitating a decrease of 30% below last year’s levels by 2030 and then a 65% decrease by 2040. Renewable energy such as solar and wind should be ramped up to take the place of gas, according to the report. Hare said that governments need to be questioned as to why they are not targeting gas as well as coal. “Ultimately, gas is a bridge to nowhere,” he said.",4
environment/2021/aug/02/is-remote-working-better-for-the-environment-not-necessarily,Environment,environment/2021/aug/02/is-remote-working-better-for-the-environment-not-necessarily,Companies have a rare moment to reset working models. But climate calculations of remote v office work are complex,"Stacy Kauk was finalizing Shopify’s 2019 sustainability report when the pandemic forced the company into remote work. “I kind of stopped in my footsteps and went, ‘Uh oh, what’s going to happen if we’re closing our offices during Covid and staying remote in the long term? What does that mean for Shopify’s corporate carbon footprint?’” said Kauk, who directs the Canadian e-commerce company’s $5m annual sustainability fund. It’s a vital question that companies may need to ask as they start to redefine their working models in the wake of the pandemic – though sustainability experts worry that not all will. For the roughly 20% to 40% of employees who can work from home, many companies are announcing that post-pandemic work won’t necessarily take place at work – at least not five days a week. Microsoft, Spotify, Salesforce, Google, Facebook, Nationwide insurance, Capital One and Citigroup, among others, have embraced hybrid configurations combining remote work and time in the office. There soon could be four times as many people working from home as did pre-Covid. There’s an intuitive assumption – encouraged by lockdown memories of rush-hour quiet and dissipated smog – that remote work is de facto better for the environment. But it’s not yet clear how radically shifting the way business is done will alter the climate impacts of doing business. Shopify’s CEO declared in May of last year that remote work would become a permanent fixture. Accounting for the energy consumption of its nearly 6,000 employees working from home in 2020, Shopify’s emissions dropped 29%, according to Kauk. But “last year isn’t typical remote work,” she said. “It’s remote work during Covid.” What happens when the world opens back up? Kauk posed the dilemma to Watershed, a software outfit that helps companies track and reduce their carbon footprints. “Now that we’re going back to work, it’s this rare once-a-decade reset moment when companies can redefine their working model and do it with an eye on carbon,” said Taylor Francis. “The punchline is that it’s more complicated than meets the eye.” Take commuting. Transportation is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the US, and more than half come from personal vehicles. Close to 90% of people drive to work – usually alone – and the daily back and forth accounts for nearly 30% of the miles American workers drive in a year. Doing away with millions of workers’ daily commutes seems like an easy climate win. Carbon dioxide emissions from transportation dropped 15% last year as people hunkered at home. When workers’ homes become their offices, commutes may fall out of the carbon equation, but what’s happening inside those homes must be added in. How much energy is being used to run the air conditioner or heater? Is that energy coming from clean sources? In some parts of the country during lockdown, average home electricity consumption rose more than 20% on weekdays, according to the International Energy Agency. IEA’s analysis suggests workers who use public transport or drive less than four miles each way could actually increase their total emissions by working from home. Looking further ahead, the questions multiply. Many Shopify employees live near the office and walk, bike or take public transit. Will remote work mean they move from city apartments to sprawling suburban homes, which use, on average, three times more energy? Will they buy cars? Will they be electric or gas-powered SUVs? “You have company control over what takes place in the office,” Kauk noted. “When you have everyone working remotely from home, corporate discretion is now employee discretion.” There’s also the question of flying. While business travel is still down about 70%, most business leaders expect it to return to pre-pandemic levels. Francis is concerned that companies with distributed workforces will more than make up for saved daily commuting emissions by flying in staff for quarterly gatherings. One round-trip flight from Chicago to Los Angeles releases nearly as much CO2 as three months of a 10-mile driving commute. Kauk said Shopify will incorporate the emissions data it collects into planning employee gatherings. Letting workers who can work remotely split their time between home and office is emerging as the dominant choice for companies navigating the new normal. But hybrid working could create a “worst-case scenario”, according to a June study from the Carbon Trust and Vodafone Institute for Society and Communications. “This split could result in consuming more energy and emitting more emissions as both homes and offices are fully operating to enable teleworkers and office workers to do their jobs,” the report warned. Watershed’s modeling suggests the same. “This kind of hybrid world isn’t quite as good as everyone thinks,” said Francis. “I see a lot of companies unwittingly creating a higher-carbon workplace than the one they had before Covid.” He added: “I think they are well-intentioned, but unfortunately common sense is not the same thing as carbon math.” Reducing office footprints can reduce carbon footprints, but that, too, comes with caveats. To achieve a hybrid model, companies are closing offices or redesigning them to accommodate fewer workers: Nearly three-quarters of Fortune 500 CEOs expect to downsize office space post-pandemic. But many executives may fail to consider the climate cost of downsizing, said Trevor Langdon, president of environmental firm Green Standards. Furniture waste is frequently overlooked, said Langdon, even by companies that track sustainability efforts. “They might be reporting on things like energy consumption, and reduction in paper waste or food waste in their cafeteria,” but when they close or renovate their offices, “a dozen floors of furniture go rolling out the back door into the landfill and nobody is capturing that environmental impact”. When Hootsuite redesigned its Vancouver office earlier this year, Green Standards says it kept 19 tons of material out of landfill, recycling 20% and donating the rest to local non-profits. The firm offers a resale platform so employees can buy decommissioned office equipment for their home work spaces, such as monitors and $1,000 desk chairs that go for a few hundred dollars. Managing how employees work is ultimately a small part of the equation when it comes to curbing corporate emissions and achieving net-zero goals, said María Mendiluce, CEO of the We Mean Business Coalition. But she sees positives in the way businesses were able to drastically shift mindset during the pandemic and reinvent how they operated in a matter of months. It proves how resilient they are to major shocks, she said, and they’ll need to be as the climate crisis worsens: “It’s an incredible lesson.” Francis hopes all companies realize the potential for positive change. “I think there’s a real risk that companies miss the boat on what could be a really important moment to bend the carbon curve over the long term,” he said.  This article was amended on 6 August 2021 to correct a misspelling of Trevor Langdon’s surname.",6
environment/2021/sep/09/big-oil-delay-tactics-new-climate-science-denial,Environment,environment/2021/sep/09/big-oil-delay-tactics-new-climate-science-denial,Academic researchers say the fossil fuel industry has a new tool to delay efforts to curb emissions – a social justice strategy,"ExxonMobil has been touting its commitment to “reducing carbon emissions with innovative energy solutions”. Chevron would like to remind you it is keeping the lights on during this dark time. BP is going #NetZero, but is also very proud of the “digital innovations” on its new, enormous oil drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile Shell insists it really supports women in traditionally male-dominated jobs. A casual social media user might get the impression the fossil fuel industry views itself as a social justice warrior, fighting on behalf of the poor, the marginalized, and women – at least based on its marketing material in recent years. These campaigns fall into what a handful of sociologists and economists call “discourses of delay”. While oil and gas companies have a long track record of denying climate change, even after their own scientists repeatedly warned of the harm caused by burning fossil fuels, now the industry’s messaging is far more subtle and in many ways more effective than outright climate science denial. By downplaying the urgency of the climate crisis, the industry has new tools to delay efforts to curb fossil fuel emissions. And worse yet: even industry critics haven’t fully caught up to this new approach. “If you just focus on climate denial, then all of this other stuff is missed,” explains Robert Brulle, an environmental sociologist and visiting professor at Brown University. Brulle, who published a peer-reviewed study in 2019 that analyzed major oil corporations’ advertising spending over a 30-year period, says the “lion’s share” of ad dollars were directed not toward denial, or even toward the industry’s products, but toward pro-fossil fuel propaganda – campaigns that remind people over and over again about all the great things oil companies do, how dependent we are on fossil fuels, and how integral the industry is to society. “They’re spending probably five or 10 times more on all this corporate promotion advertising,” he says. “And yet the climate movement seems to only focus on the science denial part.” Oil companies stopped pushing overt climate denial more than a decade ago. And while conspiracy theories claiming climate change is a hoax may surface occasionally, they are no longer an effective strategy. Instead, the fossil fuel industry, utilities and the various trade groups, politicians and think tanks that carry water for both, have pivoted to messages that acknowledge the problem, but downplay its severity and the urgency for solutions. Instead companies are overstating the industry’s progress toward addressing climate change. In a paper published in the journal Global Sustainability last July, economist William Lamb and nearly a dozen co-authors catalogued the most common messaging from those who would prefer to see inaction on climate for as long as possible. According to Lamb’s team, the industry’s “discourses of delay” fall into four buckets: redirect responsibility (consumers are also to blame for fossil fuel emissions), push non-transformative solutions (disruptive change is not necessary), emphasize the downside of action (change will be disruptive), and surrender (it’s not possible to mitigate climate change). “This was a paper that was born on Twitter, funnily enough,” Lamb says. Lamb and collaborators Giulio Mattoli and Julia Steinberger began compiling the fossil fuel messaging they saw repeatedly on social media. Then they asked other academics from various fields to add what they were seeing too, and patterns soon emerged. Lamb says they explicitly left denial out of the equation. “What we tried to do was really examine delay as something distinct,” he says. “From our view, delay had not received the kind of attention it deserves.” Of all the messaging geared toward delaying action on climate, or assurances that the fossil fuel industry has a grip on possible solutions, Lamb and other authors agreed that one theme was far more prevalent than the rest: “the social justice argument.” This strategy generally takes one of two forms: either warnings that a transition away from fossil fuels will adversely impact poor and marginalized communities, or claims that oil and gas companies are aligned with those communities. Researchers call this practice “wokewashing”. An email Chevron’s PR firm CRC Advisors sent to journalists last year is a perfect example. It urged journalists to look at how green groups were “claiming solidarity” with Black Lives Matter while “backing policies which would hurt minority communities”. Chevron later denied that it had anything to do with this email, although it regularly hires CRC and the bottom of the email in question read: “If you would rather not receive future communications from Chevron, let us know by clicking here.” Another common industry talking point argues a transition away from fossil fuels will be unavoidably bad for impoverished communities. The argument is based on the assumption that these communities value fossil fuel energy more than concerns about all of its attendant problems (air and water pollution, in addition to climate change), and that there is no way to provide poor communities or countries with affordable renewable energy. Chevron also claimed solidarity with Black Lives Matter last year, although it is also responsible for polluting the Black-majority city it’s headquartered in: Richmond, California, where Chevron also pays for a larger-than-average police force. Meanwhile the American Petroleum Institute, Big Oil’s largest trade group and lobbyist, funds diversity in stem programs, but it also declines to acknowledge the disproportionate impacts on communities of color. Discourses of delay don’t just show up in advertising and marketing campaigns, but in policy conversations too. “We’ve gone through thousands of pieces of testimony on climate and clean energy bills at the state level, and all of the industry arguments against this sort of legislation included these messages,” says J Timmons Roberts, professor of environment and sociology at Brown University, and a co-author on the “discourses of delay” paper. In a recently published study focused on delay tactics in Massachusetts, for example, Roberts and his co-authors catalogued how fossil fuel interest groups and utility companies in particular used discourses of delay to try to defeat clean energy legislation. Another recent study found similar campaigns against clean energy and climate bills in Connecticut. “The social justice argument is the one we’re seeing used the most,” he says. Lamb sees the same thing happening in Europe. “Often you do see those arguments come from right of center politicians, which suggests hypocrisy in a way because they’re not so interested in the social dimension on parallel issues of social justice like education policy or financial policy.” While the social justice argument stands out as a favorite at the moment, Lamb says the others are in regular rotation too, from focusing on what individual consumers should be doing to reduce their own carbon footprints to promoting the ideas that technology will save us and that fossil fuels are a necessary part of the solution. “These things are effective, they work,” Roberts says. “So what we need is inoculation – people need a sort of field guide to these arguments so they’re not just duped.” This story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story.",3
environment/2021/jun/11/antonio-guterres-interview-climate-crisis-pandemic-g7,Environment,environment/2021/jun/11/antonio-guterres-interview-climate-crisis-pandemic-g7,UN secretary general says he’s concerned that the richest nations have pumped billions more into fossil fuels than clean energy since the pandemic,"Wealthy countries risk an “unforgivable lost opportunity” by not emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic with newly green economies to address the climate crisis, the United Nations secretary general has warned. Before meeting the leaders of the world’s major economic powers at the G7 summit in the UK, António Guterres said he was concerned that the richest nations have pumped billions of dollars more into fossil fuels than clean energy since the pandemic, despite their promises of a green recovery. “I’m more than disappointed, I’m worried about the consequences,” Guterres told the Guardian at the UN headquarters in New York, as part of a Covering Climate Now consortium of interviews alongside NBC News and El Pais. “We need to make sure we reverse the trends, not maintain the trends. It’s now clear we are coming to a point of no return. “To spend these trillions of dollars and not use this occasion to reverse the trends and massively invest in the green economy will be an unforgivable lost opportunity.” A recent analysis showed the G7 countries – the UK, US, Canada, Italy, France, Germany and Japan – have committed $189bn to support oil, coal and gas, as well as offer financial lifelines to the aviation and automotive sectors, since the outbreak of the coronavirus. This is over $40bn more than has been directed towards renewable energy. Several leaders, including the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have stressed the need for the climate crisis to be central to the Covid recovery, with various cities around the world ushering in cyclists and pedestrians to streets previously dominated by cars. But while the G7 countries have agreed to stop the international financing of coal, the world’s wealthiest nations are pouring billions of dollars into developing gas, another fossil fuel, in the global south at a rate four times that of finance supporting wind or solar projects. With economies starting to reopen, planet-heating emissions are expected to jump by the second biggest annual rise in history in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency. Guterres said he welcomed the G7 commitment as “many countries are still addicted to coal” but that much more needed to be done in what he called a “make-or-break year” that will be rounded off by crucial UN climate talks in Scotland in November. “We need to abolish subsidies to fossil fuels, this is a central question,” he said. “We have to look at the real costs that exist in the economy, which means a price on carbon. If we do these things, many of the investments made to fossil fuels in the recovery phase will obviously not be profitable. They will be stranded assets with no future.” A key priority for the UN secretary general at the G7 summit will be to press leaders on the contentious issue of climate finance. As part of the landmark Paris climate agreement in 2015, rich countries agreed to provide $100bn a year to developing countries to help them adapt to the damaging flooding, drought, heatwaves and other impacts of the climate crisis. This money has never been delivered in full, however, and Guterres said it will be “impossible” to effectively deal with the climate crisis without assistance for poorer countries. He said the G7 will need to deliver the money to “rebuild trust” with developing nations. “The $100bn is essential,” said the secretary general. “Climate action has until now been centered on mitigation, on reducing emissions. But developing countries have huge problems in adaption from the existing impacts of climate change.” Guterres said he was hopeful that Joe Biden will be able to mobilize other countries to meet commitments on climate aid as the US continues its reintegration into international climate diplomacy following the presidency of Donald Trump. But the US has “a lot of catching up to do”, said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh. “Biden doesn’t get a free pass because it’s the US that caused the damage. If you fail to deliver for the rest of the world that will be our problem and it will come back to bite you.” Scientists recently warned that the world could breach, albeit temporarily, the 1.5C average temperature increase limit set out in the Paris agreement within the next five years. Guterres, however, said it’s “not only possible, it’s necessary” to strive to avoid global heating above this threshold, beyond which disastrous climate impacts are expected. “We still have time, but we are on the verge,” he said. “When you’re on the verge of the abyss, you need to make sure your next step is in the right direction.”",4
environment/2021/jul/23/australias-reliance-on-gas-exports-questioned-as-japan-winds-down-fossil-fuel-power,Environment,environment/2021/jul/23/australias-reliance-on-gas-exports-questioned-as-japan-winds-down-fossil-fuel-power,Government urged to speed up transition to green energy as Australia’s biggest market shifts away from LNG and coal,"A Japanese pledge to wind down gas and coal-fired electricity much faster than previously planned has sparked warnings Australia needs to speed up a transition away from fossil fuel exports. A draft revised energy mix released by Japanese officials on Wednesday said the country – Australia’s biggest market for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and thermal coal – would cut gas-fired electricity generation nearly in half and reduce coal power by more than a third by 2030. The plan, devised to help the country ramp up emissions cuts by 2030, would require renewable energy to provide up to 38% of generation. Coal, LNG and nuclear energy would each provide about 20%. While a shift away from coal has been widely forecast, the expected fall in Japanese gas-fired electricity is at odds with claims by the Australian government and the $36bn LNG export industry that its product would displace coal and help reduce global emissions. Llewelyn Hughes, an associate professor at the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, said the Japanese announcement was a “big deal” for Australia and consistent with the country’s target of having 45GW of offshore wind energy capacity – nearly equivalent to Australia’s current power grid – by 2040. He said some thought it would be challenging for Japan to meet its revised targets, but the commitment showed the country was on a trajectory to using fewer fossil fuels. “It indicates a long-term decline in coal and gas,” Hughes said. Over the past year, the Japanese prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, has set national targets of net zero emissions by 2050 and a 46% cut by 2030 compared with 2013 levels. The 2030 target had previously been a 26% cut. Rebecca Mikula-Wright, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said the draft energy mix was “a clear signal of the country’s intent to speed up its decarbonisation”. Australia’s other major customers in Asia – China and South Korea – were also heading towards net zero emissions and would reduce demand over the coming decade, she said. “To remain competitive in global export markets, Australia needs to quickly put in place the right climate policy and investment signals to help ensure we are producing the green energy and other products that our major trading partners will increasingly demand,” she said. The country’s oil and gas lobby group, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, rejected suggestions Japan’s shift meant gas would play a declining role. Its chief executive, Andrew McConville, said Australian LNG was “an important part of a cleaner energy future” and would “still be needed in Japan to power their large manufacturing industry”. He said demand for gas in Asia had been forecast to grow significantly by 2040 and that gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS) was “a pathway to a large-scale clean hydrogen industry”. Gas is used not only in electricity generation but also manufacturing industries, heating and cooking. It is often said to have about half the emissions of coal when burned, but studies have suggested this is an underestimate once leakage of methane – a potent greenhouse gas – during extraction and transportation is counted. A recent major IEA report suggested the world should not open any new oil or gas fields or coal plants if it was to have a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But the prime minister, Scott Morrison, recently told the oil and industry it would “always” be a major contributor to Australia’s prosperity. It has committed $224m to to develop new gas fields in the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo Basin. Labor also supports opening up new gas reserves. On Thursday, the resources minister, Keith Pitt, said the government would continue to “prioritise unlocking new sources of gas supply”. He said Japan was only one of Australia’s customers and demand from other Asian countries was set to rise. “Fast-growing nations such as India, China, Vietnam, Pakistan, Thailand and Bangladesh will likely take more Australian LNG,” he said. Australia’s gas export industry has grown exponentially in northern Western Australia and Queensland since 2014. A June summary of resources and energy data published by the federal industry department showed Japan bought 37.9% of Australia’s LNG and 36.5% of thermal coal exports over the past year. Together, they were worth $22bn. The extraction and processing of the gas have been responsible for a significant rise in Australia’s industrial emissions that, according to government reports, has effectively replaced some of the reduction in carbon dioxide caused by an influx of solar and wind into the electricity grid. The government and industry justify the LNG industry’s local emissions by arguing Australian LNG has the potential to reduce global emissions by about 170m tonnes a year by displacing coal. Neither has produced evidence to show this is happening. The federal Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the Japanese announcement showed the major parties were giving communities “false hope” about coal and gas continuing for decades. The bipartisan political support to open the Beetaloo Basin was “economic and environmental madness”, he said. “It’s time to face facts and tell workers in Queensland and New South Wales the truth. Coal and gas are now on borrowed time and we need to support workers and communities to transition,” Bandt said.",3
environment/2021/jul/02/yellowstone-geyser-old-faithful-stop-erupting-ramifications,Environment,environment/2021/jul/02/yellowstone-geyser-old-faithful-stop-erupting-ramifications,"If temperatures rise 10F by the century’s end as projected, Old Faithful could stop erupting, and the snowpack that feeds rivers throughout the west may disappear","When a band of geological surveyors and US army scouts mapped out what would become Yellowstone in 1870, the geysers and springs seemed endless – a land so unbound that Congress moved to name it the first national park in the country and arguably in the world. Nearly 150 years later, about 4 million people visit the park annually to see its most famous geyser: Old Faithful. It is a sight to behold, shooting tens of thousands of litres of boiling water hundreds of feet into the air about 17 times a day. While the geyser is highly predictable – it has erupted every 44 to 125 minutes since 2000 – a new climate assessment and a recent study have revealed that rising temperatures, reduced snowfall and increased rain threaten to shut Old Faithful off completely by the end of the century. While that could threaten the natural beauty of the park, it also means an ecosystem three times the size of Rhode Island, stretching 22m acres across Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, face a threat that no national park can protect against: rising temperatures. The land in and around Yellowstone, often called the Greater Yellowstone Area, is among the world’s last intact temperate ecosystems, and includes two national parks, five national forests, half a dozen tribal nations and stunning biodiversity. It’s also a super volcano that’s home to 10,000 hydrothermal features, including 500 geysers, the world’s greatest concentration. If temperatures at Yellowstone rise 10F (5.6C) by the end of the century, as they are projected to, this vast ecosystem will be disrupted. Old Faithful will almost surely shut off completely, and the snowpack that feeds rivers throughout the west may disappear. While the story of climate change is well-known, what’s new is the startling connection between temperature and water, a shift which threatens the extensive geyser system that makes this place so iconic. But it is not the first time this has happened. About 800 years ago, extreme heat and drought made Old Faithful come to a complete standstill for decades, a shift which changed everything from what plant species grew in the area to what the land looked like. Looking at what happened then could be a mirror to the present – a way of looking back to look forward. Academics are trying to use the park’s recent past as a sort of climate roadmap, helping us to predict what might happen next. But reading that map isn’t easy – or clean. The geological samples studied to help predict what happens next are full of mud, pollen and sludge – heavy, hard to reach and buried deep under lakes. In 2018, Chris Schiller, a post-doctoral research associate at Montana State University, set out to learn what made one lake in the geyser basin go from thermal to freshwater centuries ago, and whether that stark change may have been caused by a period of staggering heat and drought that looks very much like the temperature shifts we are experiencing today. In the lab, Schiller’s team discovered evidence of fire, drought and temperature shifts in the sediment. The why remains more opaque, but we do know that the conditions that led to this transformation occurred in a period of extreme dryness, like today. But what can this study tell us about the future? “The best part of science is you find something no one else has ever seen, something new, and that’s what happened at Goose Lake. We’re still trying to figure out what it means,” says Cathy Whitlock, a paleo-climatologist at Montana State University, and Schiller’s research partner and co-author. What we do know, she says, is that the period of mega droughts that caused Old Faithful to dry up was potentially less extreme than now. “We are now moving into a climate that seems even warmer and drier than those periods. That’s crazy,” she says, adding: “It’s possible that this whole geyser basin and the plumbing is going to change.” Whitlock specializes in long-term environmental and climate change, and has spent four decades sifting through these sediment-rich lakes, publishing more than 200 scientific papers on the topic. She is the co-author of the first ever climate assessment of Yellowstone, which showed that since 1950, the area’s average temperature has increased by 2.3F (1.3C). Such a small shift may seem benign – until you realize that the last Ice Age was only about 5-7F (2.8-3.9C) colder than the pre-industrial period. In recent decades, the average temperature in the park has been as high as or higher than in any period in the last 20,000 years, and could be the warmest of the last 800,000 years, according to the recent Yellowstone climate assessment. One clue as to what will happen next can be found by looking at plant fossils. Schiller and Whitlock’s work showed that about 4,000 years ago, a cool, wet period abruptly ended, and the temperatures looked a lot like today. Modern Yellowstone is known for thick pine forests, expansive geyser basins with grassy vistas that break the tree cover. When the team analyzed the pollen buried in Goose Lake, they found that once the temperature heated up, the pine stopped growing and there was a sudden explosion of sagebrush and other grasses that do well in hotter climates. This points to drought at the time, Whitlock says. So far, no one is 100% sure whether the changes were caused by climate alone. But as trees die off due to the hotter climate, forests may shrink in the coming decades, which will have a cascading effect: less forest and fewer tree roots mean more grass and more erosion. Drier grass means fewer nutrients for large mammals. Less water also hurts everything from migratory and aquatic species to grazers like bison, who face decreased nutrients from dry plants. Big flora like whitebark pine, a key species already vulnerable from years of destructive beetle outbreaks associated with rising temperatures, now face a 79% mortality rate, further increasing soil erosion and disappearing habitat. Each dry domino is an accelerant which further reduces snow and water flow and turns already dry vegetation into spark-hungry tinder. Extreme weather is now the norm and blazes like Yellowstone’s huge 1988 fires – which burned 800,000 acres – are a seasonal worry. “We’re facing a critical moment,” Schiller says, referencing the current situation at Yellowstone. But the new climate report could jumpstart locals to begin discussing the changes around them. Whitlock points out that ranchers, miners and tourism are all set to be affected should the pristine settings and the water these mountains produce dry up – which could ultimately mean financial losses. 
 The Yellowstone, Snake and Green Rivers feed major tributaries for the Missouri, Columbia and Colorado Rivers – vital for agriculture, recreation, energy production even the water we receive in our kitchen sinks. Regional farming – potatoes, hay, alfalfa – and cattle ranching depend on late season irrigation, threatened by reduced snowfall. And a big question mark hangs over the rapidly growing tourism and hospitality industries that rely on Yellowstone’s world-class rivers and ski areas for angling and black diamond runs. Whitlock says the most important part of her career is giving people evidence of the changes she sees happening – even if they aren’t always keen to hear it. And while her work helps to reconstruct the past, she hopes it can also help to change the path we are on, before projections become reality. “The trajectory we take depends on what we do about greenhouse gas now. By 2040, 2050, we can flatten the curve.” Her voice lowers and she collects herself. “What we do in the next decade is critical. We have new technologies, we can solve this. We just need the will to do it.”  This article was amended on 29 July 2021 to clarify that there is an element of debate about the world’s first national park. While Yellowstone has a strong claim, arguments are also put forward for Bogd Khan Uul in Mongolia, which was made a protected area in 1783.",1
environment/2021/jul/19/big-oil-climate-crisis-lobby-group-api,Environment,environment/2021/jul/19/big-oil-climate-crisis-lobby-group-api,The American Petroleum Institute receives millions from oil companies – and works behinds the scenes to stall or weaken legislation,"When Royal Dutch Shell published its annual environmental report in April, it boasted that it was investing heavily in renewable energy. The oil giant committed to installing hundreds of thousands of charging stations for electric vehicles around the world to help offset the harm caused by burning fossil fuels. On the same day, Shell issued a separate report revealing that its single largest donation to political lobby groups last year was made to the American Petroleum Institute, one of the US’s most powerful trade organizations, which drives the oil industry’s relationship with Congress. Contrary to Shell’s public statements in support of electric vehicles, API’s chief executive, Mike Sommers, has pledged to resist a raft of Joe Biden’s environmental measures, including proposals to fund new charging points in the US. He claims a “rushed transition” to electric vehicles is part of “government action to limit Americans’ transportation choice”. Shell donated more than $10m to API last year alone. And it’s not just Shell. Most other oil conglomerates are also major funders, including ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP, although they have not made their contributions public. The deep financial ties underscore API’s power and influence across the oil and gas industry, and what politicians describe as the trade group’s defining role in setting major obstacles to new climate policies and legislation. Critics accuse Shell and other major oil firms of using API as cover for the industry. While companies run publicity campaigns claiming to take the climate emergency seriously, the trade group works behind the scenes in Congress to stall or weaken environmental legislation. Earlier this year, an Exxon lobbyist in Washington was secretly recorded by Greenpeace describing API as the industry’s “whipping boy” to direct public and political criticism away from individual companies. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and strident critic of big oil’s public relations tactics, accused API of “lying on a massive industrial scale” about the climate crisis in order to stall legislation to combat global heating. “The major oil companies and API move very much together,” he said. Whitehouse said the oil and gas industry now recognizes it is no longer “socially acceptable” to outright deny climate change, and that companies are under pressure to claim they support new energy solutions that are less harmful to the environment. But that does not mean their claims should be taken at face value. “The question as to whether they’re even sincere about that, or whether this is just ‘Climate is a hoax 2.0’, is an unknown at this point,” he added. Shell has defended its funding by saying that while it is “misaligned” with some of API’s policies, the company continues to sit on the group’s board and executive committee in order to have “a greater positive impact” from within. The petroleum firm claims that its influence helped manoeuvre API, which represents about 600 drilling companies, refiners and other interests such as plastics makers, toward finally supporting a tax on carbon earlier this year. With Biden in the White House and growing public awareness of global heating, there are signs API’s influence may be weakening as its own members become divided on how to respond. The French oil company Total quit the group earlier this year over its climate policies. Shareholder rebellions are pressing Exxon and Chevron to move away from dependence on oil. Top clean energy executives at Shell quit in December over the pace of change by the company. API is also fighting a growing number of lawsuits, led by the state of Minnesota, alleging that the trade group was at the heart of a decades-long “disinformation campaign” on behalf of big oil to deny the threat from fossil fuels. But despite threats to API’s lasting influence, Whitehouse argues the trade organization represents the true face of the industry. Instead of using its considerable power to push for environmentally friendly energy laws, API is still lobbying to stall progress with the oil industry’s blessing. “Their political effort at this point is purely negative, purely against serious climate legislation. And many of them continue to fund the fraudulent climate denialists that have been their mouthpieces for a decade or more,” Whitehouse said. Since API was founded in 1919 out of an oil industry cooperation with the government during the first world war, it has evolved into a major political force with nearly $240m in annual revenue. Its board has been dominated by heavyweights from big oil, such as Rex Tillerson, the Exxon chief who went on to become Donald Trump’s secretary of state, and Tofiq Al Gabsani, the chief of Saudi Refining, a subsidiary of the giant state-owned Aramco oil giant. Al Gabsani was also registered as a lobbyist for the Saudi government. API also hired professional lobbyists, including Philip Cooney, who went on to serve under George W Bush as chief of staff of the Council on Environmental Quality until he was forced to resign in 2005 after tampering with government climate assessments to downplay scientific evidence of global heating and to emphasise doubts. Shortly afterward, Cooney was hired by Exxon. API came into its own as the realities of the climate crisis crept into public and political discourse, and the industry found itself on the defensive. The trade group, which claimed to represent companies supporting 10m jobs and nearly 8% of the US economy, played a central role in efforts to combat new environmental regulations. In many cases, API was prepared to carry out the dirty work that individual companies did not want to be held responsible for. In 1998, after countries signed the Kyoto Protocol to help curb carbon emissions, API drew up a multimillion-dollar disinformation campaign to ensure that “climate change becomes a non-issue”. The plan said “victory will be achieved” when “recognition of uncertainties become part of the ‘conventional wisdom’”. Much of this is the basis of several lawsuits against API. The first was filed last year by the Minnesota attorney general, Keith Ellison, who accuses the group of working alongside ExxonMobil and Koch Industries to lie about the scale of the climate crisis. The suit alleges that “previously unknown internal documents” show that API and the others well understood the dangers for decades but “engaged in a public-relations campaign that was not only false, but also highly effective” to undermine climate science. The city of Hoboken in New Jersey is also suing API, claiming that it engaged in a conspiracy by joining and funding “front groups” that ran “deceptive advertising and communications campaigns that promote climate disinformation and denialism”. The lawsuits allege that API funded scientists known to deny or underplay climate changes, and gave millions of dollars to ostensibly independent organisations, such as the Cato Institute and the George C Marshall Institute, which denied or downplayed the growing environmental crisis. “API has been a member of at least five organizations that have promoted disinformation about fossil-fuel products to consumers,” Ellison alleges in Minnesota’s lawsuit. “These front groups were formed to provide climate disinformation and advocacy from a seemingly objective source, when, in fact, they were financed and controlled by ExxonMobil and other sellers of fossil-fuel products.” It wasn’t always this way. When Terry Yosie joined API in 1988 as vice-president for health and environment, the trade group had spent years funding scientists to research climate issues after hearing repeated warnings. In 1979, API and its members formed the Climate and Energy Task Force of oil and gas company scientists to share research. Yosie, who moved to API from the Environmental Protection Agency, controlled a $15m budget, part of which he used to give workshops on climate change by EPA officials and other specialists. “I brought them together in front of oil industry senior level executives for the sole purpose of making sure this industry had some understanding as to what other significant stakeholders thought about climate change, where they saw the issue evolving, what information they were relying on,” he said. When Yosie left API in 1992, he believed oil the lobby group was still serious about addressing the growing evidence of climate change. But a year later, it disbanded the task force at the same time that Exxon abandoned one of the industry’s biggest research programmes to measure climate change. Yosie believes that confronted with the true extent of the looming disaster, API and the oil companies ran scared, choosing instead to pursue an agenda informed by climate denialism. “As the climate issue began to move from the periphery to the centre stage, I think there was a collective loss of confidence in the entire industry, a fear that this was not a debate that was winnable,” he said. API and its financial backers founded a front organisation, the deceptively named Global Climate Coalition, to drum up purported evidence that the climate crisis was a hoax. In the late 1990s, the GCC’s chairman, William O’Keefe, was also API’s executive vice-president, a man who falsely claimed that “climate scientists don’t say that burning oil, gas and coal is steadily warming the earth”. API and the GCC led attacks on Bill Clinton’s support for the Kyoto protocol with a “global climate science communications plan” that misrepresented the facts about global heating. The relationship between API and big oil remained exceptionally close throughout. Exxon’s chief executive served on the lobby group’s executive committee for most of the past three decades, and the two worked together in promoting denialism over the climate crisis. The focus of API’s efforts were on Congress, where it led the industry’s opposition to policies, such as the 2009 cap-and-trade legislation to control carbon emissions. “Most of the funding for the Republican party, and probably a very considerable amount of the big dark money funding behind the Republican party, comes out of the fossil fuel industry,” said Whitehouse. Last year, API indirectly gave $5m to the conservative Senate Leadership Fund to back Republican election candidates (many of whom question climate science), and to the campaigns of members of the energy committees in both houses of Congress. Growing public disquiet, and the departure of oil-friendly Donald Trump from the White House, shifted the ground for API. In March it launched a Climate Action Framework, which for the first time endorsed policies such as carbon pricing. It also stated its support for the Paris climate agreement. API called the plan “robust” but others noted the lack of specifics and its sincerity was called into question when an Exxon lobbyist was caught on camera earlier this year saying that a carbon tax will never happen and that support for the measure was a public relations ploy intended to stall more serious measures. And between API’s lost support from Total, and the Shell executives who resigned in December over what they regarded as the company’s foot-dragging on greener fuels, there are signs of shifting attitudes within the industry itself. Shell and BP have said they will continue to review their support for API. Shell said that where it disagrees with API’s position, the company “will pursue advocacy separately”. However, Peter Frumhoff, director of science and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, is sceptical that there has been any significant change in direction. “I think it’s fair to say that API and its prominent member companies have have a broadly shared goal, which is to keep the social licence of the oil and gas industry operating, and therefore enabling them to continue to extract oil and gas for as long as possible, as profitably as possible,” he said.

environment/2021/oct/21/nationals-mp-says-solar-wont-work-in-the-dark-as-party-makes-wishlist-for-supporting-net-zero-target,Environment,environment/2021/oct/21/nationals-mp-says-solar-wont-work-in-the-dark-as-party-makes-wishlist-for-supporting-net-zero-target,Barnaby Joyce says demands were not a captain’s call but most MPs were not given a copy of documents,"The federal resources minister, Keith Pitt, has declared solar panels don’t function in the dark when asked if he still believed renewables don’t work as the junior Coalition partner finalised its demands for potentially agreeing to net zero by 2050. The Nationals party room met on Thursday evening to consider structural adjustment principles to put to Scott Morrison in exchange for supporting a net zero emissions reduction target. Earlier, in parliament, Pitt laughed off a question about his previous public statements questioning the efficacy of renewable energy. Asked whether he still believed that wind, solar and battery technology didn’t work and whether investments in renewable energy delivered little more than a “warm and fuzzy feeling”, Pitt declared: “Find me a solar panel that works in the dark.” “I say to those opposite are you seriously suggesting that when there’s no sun, solar works? This is just a fundamental fact.” Pitt, a champion of Australia’s coal and gas industry, has expressed deep reluctance to adopt the mid-century target. Nationals met for close to an hour on Thursday evening ahead of talks between their leader, Barnaby Joyce, and Morrison about the terms of any agreement within the Coalition about new climate policy commitments to be unveiled ahead of the Cop26 conference in Glasgow. Four Nationals ministers – Pitt, Bridget McKenzie, David Littleproud and Kevin Hogan – have coordinated the wishlist that is now with Morrison. The four addressed their colleagues on Thursday evening and Joyce emphasised the fact that the party room owned the principles as opposed to the process being a captain’s call. Some MPs asked questions. But Nationals MPs were not given a copy of the document which is said to run to three pages. Most outside the group of four ministers, and the leader, are unaware of its contents. Some Nationals MPs were perplexed on Thursday evening about why the party room had even met given the contents of the wishlist were not distributed for discussion. MPs were told by the ministers preparing the document that the principles needed to be high level, going to the safeguards that would be required during a structural adjustment of the economy between now and 2050. They were told not to suggest specific projects such as new coal plants or roads or bridges as the price of supporting the target. The document is said to articulate principles and safeguards to secure and protect the interests of regional Australians during the transition, including by leveraging existing infrastructure and job creation programs. Senior Liberals and Nationals hope that Joyce and Morrison can come to terms over the next 48 hours. Nationals will meet again on Sunday before federal parliament resumes next week and Liberals hope the junior Coalition partner will sign off on the net zero commitment then. Morrison wants the government to have a consensus position on the mid-century target. But he has also made it clear this week the decision will be made by the cabinet. Earlier this week, McKenzie, the Nationals frontbencher, declared it would be “ugly” if Morrison committed Australia to the mid-century target without the formal imprimatur of the Nationals party room. But Morrison insisted cabinet would make the call because that process aligned with “the approach taken in the past” when it came to setting Australia’s international climate commitments – like agreeing to the Kyoto and Paris agreements. It means any ministers dissenting from the cabinet decision would need to consider their positions. While not everybody in the Liberal party room supports net zero, Morrison has a clear mandate to proceed from his own party – a point Joyce has publicly acknowledged. Australia remains under pressure from key allies to do more in the medium term. France’s ambassador this week urged the Morrison government to embrace stronger 2030 emission reduction targets as he declared there was “no room for complacency”. Jean-Pierre Thébault pointedly praised all state and territory governments for already committing to net zero by 2050 while describing NSW’s recent pledge to halve emissions by the end of this decade as being in “the right direction”. At the same climate change webinar, the Italian ambassador, Francesca Tardioli, who has previously urged the Morrison government to increase its 2030 target, said she hoped leaders of G20 nations including Australia took “the bold decisions that are needed to save our planet”. Italy is hosting the G20 summit in Rome, just before the UK hosts Cop26 in Glasgow. Morrison will attend both the G20 and the United Nations-led climate conference.",3

The Australian government lists 116 major coal and gas projects under development, each valued at more than A$50m and with the potential to reach a final investment decision in the next five years. Not all will be built, but a new report says it is an indication of the fossil fuel development that continues in Australia, including with taxpayer support, despite the Morrison government committing to net zero emissions by 2050. Launching a plan for the country to reach the target last week ahead of the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the government would “not shut down our coal or gas production”. The plan said the country’s fossil fuel export industries would continue “through to 2050 and beyond, supporting jobs and regional communities”. Angus Taylor, the emissions reduction minister, has also promised to use Cop26 to promote Australia as a safe and reliable place to invest in gas and hydrogen. An analysis by the Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank, found the most recent data from the energy and resources department’s chief economist, published last December, listed 72 coal and 44 gas and oil projects with the potential to be developed. The institute also included the proposed Beetaloo Basin gas field in the Northern Territory, which the government has committed up to $224m to develop as part of what it calls a “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic. Based on the estimated annual capacity of each proposal, it found together they could add about 146m tonnes to emissions within Australia (equivalent to a nearly 30% annual increase) during extraction and processing. The overwhelming bulk of the emissions – about 1.6bn tonnes – would be released offshore after the coal and gas was sold and burned for energy. About two-thirds of the coal projects were listed as at feasibility stage. Government officials noted there was a growing preference for mine expansions over greenfield projects and that some lenders and investors would no longer finance thermal coal, which is used in electricity generation. Richie Merzian, a former Australian government climate negotiator now with the Australia Institute, said the country continued to pursue an aggressive expansion of fossil fuels with potential emissions on the list equivalent to more than 200 coal-fired power plants. “Australia cannot claim to be acting on climate change while simultaneously expanding fossil fuel projects,” he said. The Morrison government’s position on fossil fuels is that cost and global markets will dictate the pace of the shift to cleaner technology. It has approved the expansion of four coalmines since September and in July granted a $175m loan for a new metallurgical coalmine in Queensland. On gas, it has said it hoped to develop four more basins after Beetaloo. State and territory governments under both the Coalition and Labor also back fossil fuel expansion. Hugh Saddler, an energy analyst and an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University, said the federal government was “just plugging on absolutely business-as-usual” on fossil fuels. “There’s been no thought about how you fit that into some supposed plan to reach net zero by 2050,” he said. “We know the important thing to stop the most catastrophic climate change is to stop fossil fuels, but Australia is putting its foot on the accelerator to develop coal and gas as quickly as it can and putting taxpayers’ dollars into doing that.” The government’s 2050 net zero emissions plan has been criticised for not including new policies and relying on new technology to make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in the 2030s and 40s. It says it is committing $20bn over a decade to help lower the cost of some technologies. Most of the spending is a continuation of long-standing funding for clean energy agencies. The government has backed carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology – burying greenhouse gases from industrial sites kilometres underground – to extend their life, and committed $250m to a “CCS technologies and hubs” program. Australian governments have previously committed about $4bn in funding for CCS, but it has failed to prove commercially viable. The country has one operating CCS plant, at Chevron’s Gorgon gas development in Western Australia. It has suffered delays and operational problems, and captures only a portion of the emissions at the site. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The gas company Santos confirmed on Monday it would proceed with a $220m CCS development at the Moomba gas reservoir in South Australia after the Morrison government approved it to earn revenue from carbon credits for storing emissions below ground. Santos said the project could store 1.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from 2024. The gas industry group, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, said the Australia Institute’s analysis should not be considered “objective, scientific or reasonable” as the thinktank had made its opposition to the industry “very clear”. Its chief executive, Andrew McConville, said it would be more constructive for people to listen to those that had recognised gas had a role to play in a low-emissions future, including the International Energy Agency, the United Nations, and Australia’s former chief scientist Alan Finkel. Some have backed gas – which has about half the emissions of coal when burned, and more when methane leaks during extraction – as playing an ongoing role as the world moves away from coal, but few have backed opening new gas fields.

Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull on Tuesday said Australia had to “face up to the fact that we’ve got to stop burning coal and gas”. “The proposition that seems to be fashionable in some quarters here that we can keep on burning coal, and indeed exporting coal, and that somehow is consistent with getting to net zero by 2050, is nonsense,” he told the ABC’s RN Breakfast. “The reality is if we keep burning fossil fuels we will fry the planet.” ",0
environment/2021/jul/23/whether-or-not-the-great-barrier-reef-is-listed-as-in-danger-wont-alter-the-fact-it-is-at-risk-from-climate-change,Environment,environment/2021/jul/23/whether-or-not-the-great-barrier-reef-is-listed-as-in-danger-wont-alter-the-fact-it-is-at-risk-from-climate-change,The Australian government pushed back fiercely against Unesco’s recommendation – and the world is watching,"This year, Australia’s big tourism drawcard celebrates its 40th year as a UN world heritage site – a list where more than 1,100 of humanity’s most important spots go for acknowledgement and protection. But on Friday, a committee of 21 countries will decide if it wants to listen to the advice of the UN’s science and culture organisation, Unesco, and put the Great Barrier Reef on its list of places that are “in danger”. This is not the 40th anniversary party the reef’s legions of fans had hoped for – whether they’ve admired its 2,300km kaleidoscope of corals from a coffee table book or a mask and snorkel. Because whatever happens at the meeting, there appears to be no scenario left where the threat of an “in danger” listing disappears for Australia. And whatever the committee decides, experts and campaigners say the events of recent weeks will prove to be historic not only for the reef, but for the rest of the world’s natural wonders that could be jolted onto the list by climate change. Ecosystems dominated by corals are predicted to be one of the first to collapse from global heating, caused by the world’s inability or unwillingness to cut its use of fossil fuels. After Unesco made the call to the world heritage committee last month, the Australian government launched a frantic and forceful lobbying effort to keep the reef off the list. Ambassadors from more than a dozen countries wearing fins and snorkel masks were dropped onto Agincourt Reef in the far north of Queensland, while environment minister Sussan Ley was dispatched on a diplomatic jet to Budapest, Madrid, Sarajevo, Paris, Oman and the Maldives. A document that will be put before the committee on Friday evening suggests Australia may have gained enough support among its members to stave off the “in danger” listing until at least 2023. A two-thirds majority of the committee is needed to put the reef on the list, but there could be last-minute movements. But Australia’s own amendments still leave in the text the “possible inscription” on the danger list in 2023. The reef was inscribed on the world heritage list in 1981, just three years after the very first natural sites – including the Galapagos Islands and Yellowstone National Park – were declared to have “outstanding universal value to humanity”. The potted history of how the reef made the list starts with 1960s conservation campaigns to block limestone mining and oil drilling, leading to royal commissions and ultimately laws to create the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Richard Kenchington, now a professor at the Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources and Security at the University of Wollongong, was working at the authority in the late 70s when he was asked to coordinate the report that asked the world heritage committee to inscribe the reef. Back then, the main worries for the reef, he says, were finding ways to control outbreaks of coral-eating starfish – a problem that continues today. “Being one of the first nominations for the list just came from that growing global awareness of its significance. Here was a very large marine area that was being managed under legislation and that was seen globally as very exciting.” He says the way the reef is managed is still rightly acknowledged as world-leading, but while many of the 3,000 or so individual reefs are still spectacular it will “never be the same as it was in the 1970s” before climate change took hold. As well as the climate threat, Unesco says progress has been too slow in cutting pollution that runs into the reef from farms – primarily sugarcane and grazing properties. The world heritage committee last discussed the reef in 2015, but since then there have been three mass bleaching events caused by rising ocean temperatures. Scientists spoke of emerging from the water smelling of the dead and dying flesh of corals. The system’s ability to recover was being pushed to the brink. “All of the world’s marine environments are endangered by climate change. Full stop,” says Kenchington. Alongside the government’s aggressive response to the prospect of an “in danger” listing, Unesco’s recommendation sparked an exchange of letters between the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the office of the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. The letters reveal that on Wednesday Queensland rebuffed a request from Morrison to immediately sign off on a new version of the centrepiece joint reef policy. In Paris, the Australian government’s ambassador to Unesco, Megan Anderson, had been sending a summary of the draft of that new policy to committee members. Conservationists aware of the content say in its current form it does not go far enough to either improve water quality or lock in commitments for Australia to cut emissions in line with a rise in global temperatures to 1.5C – a level Unesco has asked for. Anderson also sent committee members a draft of the Australian Institute of Marine Science’s latest annual monitoring report on the state of corals across the reef. She said it showed “widespread recovery was underway”. The report also said the increase in coral coverage since the 2020 bleaching event was dominated by fast-growing species susceptible to storms and coral-eating starfish, and would be the first to go in the next bleaching event. “The predicted consequences of climate change, which include more frequent and intense mass coral bleaching events, are now a contemporary reality,” the report said. Australia is a world-leading producer and exporter of coal and gas, and the country’s resources lobby is powerful. When the Guardian revealed oil-rich Saudi Arabia was backing Australia’s stance, there was a distinct lack of surprise in some quarters. Prof Tiffany Morrison, of James Cook University, has been researching how countries and the UN deal with threats to world heritage sites. In research published last year, she found when the world heritage committee gets asked to put places on the “in danger” list, it is resource-dependant countries that push back the hardest. But why has Australia tried so hard? Australia has made procedural arguments as it pushes back, saying Unesco should have first sent a monitoring mission (which, as the procedure dictates, Australia would need to formally request). Unesco says such a mission is not needed, especially when the evidence of the reef’s predicament is so clear. But Prof Morrison believes there’s another unstated reason for Australia’s hardcore lobbying. “If the reef goes on the ‘in danger’ list, the social licence for the government to approve more fossil fuel extraction falls over. This is not about tourism. This is about the social licence,” she says. Australia’s lobbying effort, she says, has now set up a test of the world heritage committee’s integrity. “This is pivotal. Do [the committee members] hold up the intentions of the convention [to protect the world’s heritage] or do they allow that to be undermined?” She says Unesco has previously shied away from trying to address threats to sites that aren’t immediately local – with climate change being the most obvious “non-local” threat. “But climate change is now affecting everything, and you can’t really ignore it anymore,” she says. “This is pivotal for the world heritage committee in that they begin to address climate change in a way that they have never done before.” This lack of precedent, Prof Morrison says, is being used by Australia to say climate change should be left to the UN convention that delivered the Paris agreement. Daniel Gschwind is the chief executive of Queensland’s main tourism body, the Queensland Tourism Industry Council. The degradation of parts of the reef, the bleaching events that create international headlines and how to engage with those issues as visitors step on boats is a challenge, Gschwind says. He says the reef is well managed and remains a spectacular experience for tourists. “But we have to confront these things head-on and with a degree of honesty,” he says. “We owe it to ourselves to go with the science. “The tourism operators are obviously not excited about the prospect of the reef being in the headlines for the wrong reasons. That’s not good news for us. “But whatever way the decision goes, either now or in the future, I firmly believe this has to be our call to the world to do more on climate change. The reef is threatened and we need to do something about it.”",0
environment/2021/aug/31/australian-greenhouse-emissions-down-5-in-a-year-of-covid-but-rebound-expected,Environment,environment/2021/aug/31/australian-greenhouse-emissions-down-5-in-a-year-of-covid-but-rebound-expected,Angus Taylor says Australia on track to meet Paris agreement climate commitments but analysts say data largely reflects impact of pandemic,"Australia’s national greenhouse gas emissions increased fractionally in the first quarter of 2021 but dropped about 5% across the previous year as the pandemic dramatically slowed transport and some heavy industry, official data says. The latest official quarterly greenhouse gas inventory released by federal energy department officials is the first to cover a full year in which Covid-19 was affecting the country. It found national emissions fell 5.3% over the year to March 2021, largely due to a steep drop in pollution from transport (down 13.2%, or 13.1m tonnes of CO2) and fugitive emissions from coalmines and gas wells (down 8.3% or 4.5m tonnes). Both were affected by Covid-19 shutdowns, but the report said fugitive emissions also fell in part due to the operation of Chevron’s Gorgon carbon capture and storage system, which after years of delays started in late 2019 to re-inject CO2 from a gas well into a reservoir under Barrow Island in the Pilbara. Emissions from electricity generation also fell – by 5.6%, or 9.7m tonnes, across the year – continuing the trend of renewable energy displacing coal-fired power. The emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said emissions had fallen “to the lowest level on record” – 494.2m tonnes for the year – “even as the Australian economy recovers from the global pandemic”. He said the emissions were now 20.8% below 2005 levels, putting the country on track to meet the target set six years ago as part of the Paris agreement – a 26-28% cut. But analysts said, with the exception of the electricity sector, the data largely just demonstrated the impact of the coronavirus. The report found emissions “in trend terms” had increased slightly, by 0.3%, from the December to the March quarter, largely due to transport and fugitive emissions starting to rebound. It said preliminary estimates of emissions for the June quarter suggested they had continued to increase back to near pre-pandemic levels for the quarter, and about 500m tonnes for the 2020-21 financial year. But it is expected they would fall again for the September quarter as the country’s two largest states endure extended lockdowns. Taylor acknowledged emissions had increased in the most recent quarter for which data was available, but said the economy had grown by 1.8% over the same period. “While there is still work to be done, this data shows the government’s comprehensive suite of policies to meet its emissions reduction commitments, encourage innovation and back new and emerging low emissions technologies are working,” Taylor said. The opposition climate change and energy spokesperson, Chris Bowen, said Taylor was engaging in the “normal spin” by saying the government would meet and beat its emissions targets. “Angus Taylor and Scott Morrison have nothing to be proud of,” he said. “They should go to [the November Cop26 climate summit in] Glasgow with better targets and they should admit that their actions have actually seen no reduction in emissions. The only reduction in emissions they can claim credit for is as a result of the Covid recession.” The Greens’ leader, Adam Bandt, agreed the data showed that emissions were increasing under the Coalition if not for the impact of Covid-19. “The only climate policy Scott Morrison has is the pandemic, and these figures show that as soon as lockdowns ease the Liberals lift pollution,” he said. “These figures will get even worse if Liberal and Labor succeed in opening new fossil fuel projects like the Beetaloo gas basin. It’s an emergency and we have to keep coal and gas in the ground.” Analysis of the data by Tim Baxter, senior researcher with the Climate Council, reinforced that the emissions cuts since 2005 were overwhelmingly due to a reduction in land-clearing and forest destruction for agricultural expansion and logging, not a cut in fossil fuel use. The report found Australia’s annual emissions fell 128.8m tonnes between the start of 2005 and March 2021. Most of this – 112.22m tonnes worth – was due to changes in land use and forestry that had little to do with federal climate or environmental policy. The decline in emissions in this area was caused by the Queensland state Labor government introducing laws to limit the pace of land-clearing, a general decline in native forest logging, and some forests in semi-arid areas regenerating. If land use and forestry are excluded, emissions from the rest of the economy – electricity, big industry, transport, agriculture and waste – fell by only 2.9%, or 15.57m tonnes, between 2005 and early 2021. Emissions from electricity were down nearly 17%, due to the national renewable energy target – which was met in 2019 but not extended or replaced – and the rapid fall in the cost of solar and wind energy. But emissions from transport, industry and mining were higher than in 2005 even after the impact of the pandemic-forced shutdowns was factored in. Baxter said addressing the climate crisis was a race and Australia’s response remained “sluggish and woefully inadequate”. “We are making slow and painful progress at a national level that too often comes down to dumb luck or happenstance,” he said. “The federal government has no climate or energy policy which is resulting in emissions cuts.” Richie Merzian, from the Australia Institute, said there was nothing in place nationally to reduce transport emissions. “So of course they’re going to rebound,” he said. The Australian government is facing increasing pressure before the Glasgow summit to increase the 2030 emissions target it set six years ago and join the more than 100 countries that have set a goal of reaching net zero emissions no later than 2050. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The government’s Great Barrier Reef envoy, Warren Entsch, said he had been lobbying Taylor and other senior colleagues to commit to net zero emissions by 2050 and “stronger interim emissions reduction commitments”. In a report to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, he said this year was “an incredibly important time for increasing global ambition” on climate. He said the positive cooperation at Joe Biden’s climate summit in April, when several large developed countries increased their climate targets, was a “cause for great optimism as well as introspection”, and warned Australia could find itself “corralled” by carbon tariffs if it did not do more. Entsch told Guardian Australia he believed the thinking in the Coalition on climate was “definitely” moving – those wanting greater action were “very much not in the minority now” and he would like the country to reach net zero emissions well before 2050. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, last week acknowledged in an interview with Guardian Australia that climate change was a major preoccupation in global markets and he said “progress is being made behind closed doors” on the issue within the government, but he was “very comfortable” with its 2030 target. Earlier this month, Dr Jonathan Pershing, the deputy to US presidential climate envoy John Kerry, told Guardian Australia that Australia’s targets were “not sufficient” and the country should be considering a 50% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The former UN chief Ban Ki-moon said Australia was “out of step” with the rest of the world, and the former European Union trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmström, warned it was becoming “more and more isolated” at a time when the world was increasingly being hit by floods, fires and droughts. The latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published earlier this month, found human activities were unequivocally heating the planet and causing changes not seen for centuries and in some cases thousands of years. It found greenhouse gas emissions were already affecting weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe, helping cause increased heatwaves, heavier rainfall events and more intense droughts and tropical cyclones. In Australia, average temperatures above land have already increased by about 1.4C since 1910.",2

Morrison, who in 2019 said Labor’s EV policy would “end the weekend”, on Tuesday said his plan was “built on the back of the core principles. Technology, not taxes. Choices, not mandates”. The release of the future fuels and vehicles strategy represents the first substantive announcement from the government on electric vehicles. So here is an introductory guide to what’s in it – and what’s not. Under the plan, the government says it will spend $250m – including $178m of new funding as part of a future fuels fund – to build charging stations for heavy commercial vehicles, passenger cars and households. The strategy says this investment will “deploy charging infrastructure in over 400 businesses, 50,000 households and 1,000 public charging stations”. How it will do this is not explained. Another “priority initiative” is encouraging governments and large corporates to buy EVs for business fleets. The plan states the Department of Finance is trialling battery electric vehicles in the government’s fleet of parliamentary Comcar vehicles and that hybrid vehicles make up 28% of this fleet. It says this trial will “inform the government’s future fleet purchasing decisions”. Under the plan there will be no phase-out timeline for petrol cars or targets for the take-up of zero emissions vehicles. The government says it will not introduce incentives to make it more attractive for people to buy EVs and it has ruled out introducing regulations that limit carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles. The strategy is light on key details. For instance, the government is not clear about how it defines zero emissions vehicles, and at times appears to lump hybrid vehicles with pure-battery driven electric vehicles and hydrogen-electric vehicles together. The “fleet first” strategy does not specify targets or timelines for government fleets that would encourage procurement officers to buy more EVs , and the government has only promised to “evaluate” the introduction of Euro 6 noxious emissions standards, which are part of a suite of regulations that ratchet up a vehicles engine efficiency up over time. The Australia Institute’s Audrey Quicke said the strategy “shows us more what they’re not doing than what they are”. “There’s not much new in this policy except for some charging infrastructure, which is welcome, but it’s a small piece of a thousand-piece puzzle,” he said. The government projects battery-electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles will make up 30% of new car sales by 2030, but has explicitly rejected the introduction of incentives to help people buy EVs and vehicle emissions standards to require a gradual shift to cleaner cars. It has not committed to the introduction of Euro6 standards on fuel quality. While the greater availability of charging infrastructure is necessary to allow EV expansion, there is nothing in the policy to help lower the cost of the vehicles themselves and make them more attractive to consumers. More work on this is being done by the states, but some are better than others. New South Wales has been praised for initiatives under its own electric vehicle strategy, which offers $3,000 rebates for the first 25,000 EVs sold in the state and exemptions on stamp duty. NSW and Victoria both plan for 50% of new cars sold to be EVs by 2030, while Tasmania plans for 100% of new cars by 2030. Based on electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles making up a third of all new car sales by 2030, the government projects carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced by 8m tonnes by 2035 – less than 2% of one year of Australia’s emissions. It is not clear how this figure was reached. This is only a small dent in a large section of Australia’s national emissions. Transport is responsible for nearly 20% of national carbon pollution, and that share has grown steadily over time. While Morrison has stressed his government would not be “putting mandates on [Australians] and telling them what to do”, other countries have been setting dates to ban the sale of new petrol vehicles. Among the most ambitious are Norway and South Korea with plans to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2025. The UK will ban the sale of new petrol cars from 2030, and the sale of plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2035. US states like California will phase out new petrol and diesel cars by 2035, and the Biden administration wants half of all new cars sold in the US to be electric by 2030. Meanwhile China, the world’s single largest car market, has plans to end the sale of petrol and diesel passenger cars by 2035.",10
environment/2021/jul/27/global-heating-critical-measures-tipping-point-study,Environment,environment/2021/jul/27/global-heating-critical-measures-tipping-point-study,"Carbon emissions, ocean acidification, Amazon clearing all hurtling toward new records","A new study tracking the planet’s vital signs has found that many of the key indicators of the global climate crisis are getting worse and either approaching, or exceeding, key tipping points as the earth heats up. Overall, the study found some 16 out of 31 tracked planetary vital signs, including greenhouse gas concentrations, ocean heat content and ice mass, set worrying new records. “There is growing evidence we are getting close to or have already gone beyond tipping points associated with important parts of the Earth system,” said William Ripple, an ecologist at Oregon State University who co-authored the new research, in a statement. “The updated planetary vital signs we present largely reflect the consequences of unrelenting business as usual,” said Ripple, adding that “a major lesson from Covid-19 is that even colossally decreased transportation and consumption are not nearly enough and that, instead, transformational system changes are required.” While the pandemic shut down economies and shifted the way people think about work, school and travel, it did little to reduce the overall global carbon emissions. Fossil fuel use dipped slightly in 2020, but the authors of a report published in the journal BioScience say that carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide “have all set new year-to-date records for atmospheric concentrations in both 2020 and 2021”. In April 2021, carbon dioxide concentration reached 416 parts per million, the highest monthly global average concentration ever recorded. The five hottest years on record have all occurred since 2015, and 2020 was the second hottest year in history. The study also found that ruminant livestock, a significant source of planet-warming gases, now number more than 4 billion, and their total mass is more than that of all humans and wild animals combined. The rate of forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon increased in both 2019 and 2020, reaching a 12-year high of 1.11 million hectares deforested in 2020. Ocean acidification is near an all-time record, and when combined with warmer ocean temperatures, it threatens the coral reefs that more than half a billion people depend on for food, tourism dollars and storm surge protection. However, there were a few bright spots in the study, including fossil fuel subsidies reaching a record low and fossil fuel divestment reaching a record high. In order to change the course of the climate emergency, the authors write that profound alterations need to happen. They say the world needs to develop a global price for carbon that is linked to a socially just fund to finance climate mitigation and adaptation policies in the developing world. The authors also highlight the need for a phase-out and eventual ban of fossil fuels, and the development of global strategic climate reserves to protect and restore natural carbon sinks and biodiversity. Climate education should also be part of school curricula around the globe, they say. “Policies to alleviate the climate crisis or any of the other threatened planetary boundary transgressions should not be focused on symptom relief but on addressing their root cause: the overexploitation of the Earth,” the report says. Only by taking on this core issue, the authors write, will people be able to “ensure the long-term sustainability of human civilization and give future generations the opportunity to thrive”.",1
environment/2021/jul/14/australia-to-fly-ambassadors-to-great-barrier-reef-ahead-of-in-danger-list-vote,Environment,environment/2021/jul/14/australia-to-fly-ambassadors-to-great-barrier-reef-ahead-of-in-danger-list-vote,Representatives from nine voting nations among guests on snorkelling trip as Morrison government lobbies against Unesco recommendation,"Ambassadors from more than a dozen countries will fly to the Great Barrier Reef for a snorkelling trip on Thursday as part of the Morrison government’s lobbying campaign to keep the ocean jewel off the world heritage in danger list. The government’s official reef ambassador, Warren Entsch, will host the Canberra-based diplomatic group which, he said, included nine countries with voting rights at the upcoming world heritage committee meeting. Entsch said on Wednesday the diplomats were paying their own airfare. Australia has launched an all-out lobbying offensive against a recommendation from United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) to place the reef on the world heritage in danger list. On Tuesday, Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk wrote to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, asking him to match more than $2bn of funding for renewable energy and water quality projects along the 2,300km reef. Palaszczuk wrote that new funding commitments would send a “strong signal” to the committee ahead of the meeting, which starts on Friday. A decision on the reef is currently scheduled for 23 July during the virtual meeting. The federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, is in Europe for a week of meetings to try and convince countries to vote against the “in danger” recommendation. Unesco says the committee should put the reef on the danger list after rising ocean temperatures caused mass bleaching of corals in 2016, 2017 and 2020. Targets to improve water quality had also not been met, the UN body has said. Entsch said 16 countries and the European Union had accepted an invitation from the government and would visit Agincourt Reef on a trip from Port Douglas, north of Cairns. Scientists and officials from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims) and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority would accompany the ambassadors, Entsch said, as well as tourism figures. Indigenous rangers would also be on board. “They will cover the whole ambit of the challenges [to the reef], as they should,” he said. “It is critically important that when other countries are out there judging our performance, it’s important their representatives in Australia can travel up and get first hand information.” Among the countries Entsch said had accepted the invitation were Russia, Bahrain, Hungary, Brazil, Spain and Guatemala – all countries on the 21-member world heritage committee, chaired by China. Entsch, who would not be going into the water for temporary health reasons, said: “It’s important countries that are voting on this need to be able to say they have put their head under the water and have spoken to world experts. Then they can make their own decision. This is good practice and this is what should be happening.” Rising ocean temperatures caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning have driven mass bleaching across the reef. Aims has said the reef is showing signs of recovery after benign conditions since the last bleaching event in 2020. Entsch said Australia alone could not stop coral bleaching, which would need actions from bigger economies including China, India and the United States. He revealed he had “booked a ticket” for the international climate talks to be held in Glasgow in November. He feared an “in danger” listing would send a negative signal to scientists and landholders working to improve conditions that there was “no point” in their work. Ley told a briefing of ambassadors in Canberra last week that Australia wanted Unesco to carry out a monitoring mission on the reef before it made any recommendation about an “in danger” listing. Unesco has said a monitoring mission is not always required before a recommendation for the list is made. The UN body says the “in danger” list should be seen as a chance to rally the world to the plight of the reef and to encourage action to reduce fossil fuel use. Queensland’s environment and reef minister, Meaghan Scanlon, told Guardian Australia she was disappointed to only learn of the ambassador trip on Tuesday morning, and said the state government was hoping to be able to be represented. In a letter to Morrison, Palaszczuk wrote she was “extremely concerned” about the impact on jobs if the 21-country world heritage committee placed the reef on its “in danger” list. To help avert an “in danger” listing, she said the Morrison government should match her own government’s funding to improve water quality and build more renewable energy. The letter lists four demands, including federal support to match state funding of $270m for water quality projects and $2bn for renewable energy projects. Scanlon said the reef had avoided an “in danger” listing in 2015 after the state and federal governments had shown commitments through a joint policy – the Reef 2050 plan. A similar effort was needed now, she said. That policy is currently being reviewed, and Unesco has said it wants to see a new version that “fully incorporates” recommendations from the reef’s management authority “that accelerated action at all possible levels is required to address the threat from climate change”. Scanlon said: “Clearly we all want to go to the international community with a united position and we all want to keep the reef off the in danger list.” “But we have a different view on the scale of ambition to show we are taking the concerns and the science seriously.” This story was updated on 14 July to make clear the diplomats were paying their own airfares to visit the reef",3
environment/2021/jul/29/lake-powell-arizona-utah-climate-crisis,Environment,environment/2021/jul/29/lake-powell-arizona-utah-climate-crisis,"At Lake Powell on the Arizona-Utah border, the water line has dropped to a historic low, taking a heavy toll on the local industry","Chaos erupted at Bill West’s business in Page, Arizona, last week when he was forced to tell dozens of paid clients their summer vacations were either canceled or on hold – effective immediately. West, the owner of a houseboat timeshare company, was scrambling after record-low water levels at Lake Powell – one of the most popular motorized boating destinations in the US – disrupted recreational and tourism activities throughout the region. The National Park Service abruptly announced earlier this month that houseboats could no longer use the Wahweap Launch Ramp, the busiest boat launch site in the area. Boats already cast out into the water were warned they had less than a week to return to land, or risk getting marooned. West sat in traffic for more than an hour last Friday trying to corral 30 of his houseboat timeshares from the 180-mile-long reservoir before the final deadline. Dozens of vehicles stretched for at least a mile waiting for their turn on a concrete ramp that no longer reached the water. Even four-wheel-drive trucks were getting stuck in the mud as the Lake Powell shoreline retreated faster than federal water managers expected. During what should have been prime houseboat vacation season, West says he’s forced to cancel timeshare reservations for more than 200 trips this summer. With his business slamming to a halt, he says he may have to lay off as many as 40 employees. “This is a crisis for our community that is just as bad as Covid,” West said of Page, which has a population of 7,500 and is the main service hub for Lake Powell. “It is peak season and the whole town is being hit hard – the restaurants, the grocery stores, the bars, we are all feeling it.” While climate change has exacerbated wildfires, heatwaves and flash floods this summer, it is also taking a heavy toll on the tourism industry that’s dependent on Lake Powell. Last week the water line reached a historic low of 3,554ft, a level that has not been seen since 1969, when the reservoir was first filled. The giant reservoir is currently three-quarters empty and will keep dropping at least through next spring due to record low snowpack levels in the Colorado River basin. If this trend continues, the Park Service is advising boating-based businesses like West’s to make unpredictability part of their business model. “We sent out plenty of advisories to stakeholders about the possibility of very low lake levels this year and no one took it seriously,” said Billy Shott, superintendent of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, which manages Lake Powell. He compares the park’s regular drought notices to routine avalanche alerts in the mountains. “Well, now the avalanche has actually happened. Climate change has become real at Lake Powell.” Out of seven public boat launch ramps at Lake Powell, only Bullfrog in southern Utah – a five-hour drive from Wahweap – remains reliably functional due to a series of recent ramp extensions. But that too may soon become inaccessible. The Bureau of Reclamation predicts there is a 79% chance Lake Powell will drop another 29ft from the current historic low “sometime next year”. According to a National Park Service report, Glen Canyon had 4.4 million visitors in 2019, making it one of the most visited parks in the country. The visitors spent $427m in Page and the surrounding area and supported 5,243 jobs, including providing a vital source of employment for the nearby Navajo Nation. Brent Dooley says it’s been an annual family tradition since 2004 to spend a week house-boating on Lake Powell. A total of 12 family members were planning to be on the trip this year until they were forced to make an abrupt change. “We are devastated that our vacation was cancelled,” said Dooley. “We had a really tough year with deaths in the family and all of us being together was going to be our saving grace. But then the lake level dropped and, boom, our vacation is gone.” Beyond impacts to recreation, climate change is creating other big problems for Lake Powell and its sister reservoirs in the Colorado River storage system that provides water to 40 million people in the western United States. The entire system is depleted from extreme drought conditions and Lake Mead, the country’s largest reservoir, is expected to reach a record low in August that will trigger the first ever mandatory water cutbacks to Arizona and Nevada. As water managers and the Park Service scramble to adapt an infrastructure that was designed to function optimally when Lake Powell was full – which last happened in 1999 – some environmentalists are fighting to protect the nearly 100,000 acres of land that has emerged from beneath the high water mark. Before it was buried by Lake Powell, the sprawling region of slickrock canyons called Glen Canyon was described by environmentalist and author Ed Abbey as the “living heart” of the Colorado River. And now that environmental groups, scientists, and cartographers have access to document the restored ecology in hundreds of side canyons, they say it’s time for the park officials to no longer focus solely on maintaining water-based recreation at Lake Powell. “We are not anti houseboat, we are just pro-Glen Canyon,” says Eric Balken, executive director of the not for profit Glen Canyon Institute based in Salt Lake City. “We want the ecological values of Glen Canyon to be part of the discussion about how to move forward during climate change.” Balken says there is huge potential for other recreational opportunities in the side canyons that emerge out of Lake Powell. And the Page boating industry agrees that the newly accessible scenic areas in Glen Canyon are a big draw for tourists. “My customers say they have never seen so many beautiful places to park a houseboat,” says West. “The lower the lake gets the better it becomes for camping.” If only they could get there.",1

Guardian Australia understands prime minister Scott Morrison has told colleagues he wants to increase Australia’s existing 2030 emissions reduction target as part of his current negotiations with the Nationals about new climate policies to be unveiled ahead of the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. New emissions projections to be released shortly are expected to forecast Australia will beat the current target of a 26-28% cut by 2030 compared with 2005 levels, and the prime minister wants to reflect that in a new target to be outlined ahead of Glasgow. But with some Nationals openly hostile to signing up to a mid-century net zero commitment, and others on the fence, it is unclear whether Morrison will have the political capital to be able to take the extra step and increase the 2030 target. Sources say Australia has raised with both the UK and US governments the idea of publicly declaring it would “overachieve” on its 2030 target without formally increasing the goal, but both allies have pressed Morrison to deliver the formal increase rather than window dressing. The prime minister has been under increasing pressure from the investment and business community to commit to cutting emissions by about 50% by 2030, in line with scientific advice and goals set by major developed nations ahead of Glasgow. The roadmap outlining Australia’s transition to net zero was discussed by cabinet for the first time on Wednesday afternoon. Ahead of that deliberation, sceptical Nationals asked Angus Taylor, the minister for energy and emissions reduction, to supply all the assumptions underpinning Treasury modelling informing the roadmap, not just the top-line findings. Some Nationals remain implacably opposed to adopting net zero, and the junior Coalition partner will demand new commitments to revitalise regional Australia and boost employment in return for supporting any shift in climate policy. The increasingly assertive demands from senior Nationals as the policy deliberation moves to crunch point are annoying a number of Liberal MPs who have raised objections with Morrison’s office, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and Taylor. Liberals have been advised to desist from provoking the Nationals. But some government MPs are concerned that Morrison will make oversized commitments to regional Australia in order to get the Nationals on board with a more respectable climate plan ahead of Glasgow – to the detriment of resourcing urban areas. The Coalition’s rolling deliberation comes as a new report by ClimateWorks Australia, a thinktank connected to Monash University, found promised state and territory action had set de facto national targets for 2030 equivalent to a 37-42% emissions cut, 55% of electricity coming from renewable energy and at least 30% of new cars sold being electric. The Morrison government’s climate commitments for this decade are less ambitious. It has stuck with the 26-28% emissions reduction commitment made by Tony Abbott six years ago and does not have targets for renewable energy or electric vehicle growth. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A separate report by business, union and environment groups to be released on Thursday assesses the benefits of Australia moving rapidly to build clean energy exports and finds they could surpass existing revenue from fossil fuels by 2040 and create nearly 400,000 new jobs. ClimateWorks’ Rupert Posner said states and territories had allocated billions of dollars to emissions reduction measures and made “significant and inventive” regulatory and legislative changes since the start of 2020. Commitments for 2030 included emissions cuts of about 50% in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and a goal of 50% of new car sales being electric in NSW and Victoria. The report said by July this year there was more than 10GW of new renewable energy generation and 1.4GW of new storage capacity in the pipeline. Posner said the state action did not add up to Australia playing its part in limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – a goal referenced in the Paris agreement – but showed it could. “This provides the building blocks to deliver the change that’s necessary,” he said. “[The states] have built important momentum and their current 2030 targets will get us about halfway there. The country now has the chance to capitalise on this.” A detailed ClimateWorks report last year found Australia could reach net zero emissions by 2035 using technologies that were “mostly already mature and available”. A separate report released jointly on Wednesday by the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Business Council of Australia, WWF and the ACTU suggested investment in clean exports could generate $89bn in new trade by 2040, surpassing that from fossil fuels, which would shrink as the world moved towards zero emissions. The analysis – commissioned by the groups from the consultancy Accenture – found it could create 395,000 jobs in renewable hydrogen and ammonia, green metals, critical minerals, battery manufacturing, education and training and related services. It called for coordinated national investment in seven clean export precincts across the country and the creation of a $5bn fund for workers and regions dependent on carbon-intensive industries to be run by a new “energy transition authority”.

It urged governments to require major infrastructure projects to use low carbon materials. Kelly O’Shanassy, the chief executive of the conservation foundation, said the report showed Australia could more than replace the revenue and jobs from coal and gas with clean exports. The ACTU president, Michele O’Neil, said leadership was needed from the federal government to develop a national clean exports strategy. “It is not a choice between jobs and the environment, it’s a responsibility to act on both,” she said. Martijn Wilder, the president of WWF Australia, said federal and state governments needed to work together with the private sector. “We can’t afford to squander this once in a century opportunity,” he said. “The window is closing because Australia is being outspent by other nations.”",10

The prime minister faced sustained questioning over his government’s heavily criticised record on climate action on Tuesday after a landmark assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found human activities were unequivocally heating the planet and causing changes not seen for centuries and, in some cases, thousands of years. Responding to that report, Morrison hinted to reporters that his government might have more to say on Australia’s 2030 emissions reduction target before Cop26 in Glasgow. The prime minister also continued to insist that “technological breakthroughs” would ensure the world transitioned successfully to a low emissions future. While acknowledging that transition was already happening, Morrison said regional Australians would not bear the costs of the shift away from fossil fuels. Extinction Rebellion protestors targeted Parliament House and the Lodge on Tuesday, with a small group arrested after spray painting “no time” and “duty of care” on parliament’s forecourt. Inside the building, Labor sought to compare Morrison’s rhetoric with his record. The shadow climate change minister, Chris Bowen, asked Morrison if he believed no one would match Australia’s “ambition for a technology-driven solution” – which was a statement the prime minister had made earlier on Tuesday – why did he claim before the last election “that electric vehicles would end the weekend?” On the hustings during the last election campaign in April 2019, Morrison told voters he didn’t have “a problem” with electric vehicles. But the prime minister pilloried Labor’s electric vehicles policy declaring “in typical Labor fashion, they want to ram it down the necks of all Australians”. “So the cheapest car you can currently buy, as an electric vehicle, presently, my understanding is, including all on-road costs and the rest of it, is about $45,000 to $50,000 a year,” Morrison said. “That’s the cheapest car Bill Shorten wants to make available to you to buy in the future, and I’ll tell you what – it’s not going to tow your trailer. It’s not going to tow your boat. It’s not going to get you out to your favourite camping spot with your family. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Bill Shorten wants to end the weekend when it comes to his policy on electric vehicles where you’ve got Australians who love being out there in their four-wheel drives.” The Coalition’s rhetorical attacks were supplemented by advertising on Facebook posted by the Liberal party’s official account. The campaign stated that “Labor’s car tax would mean higher prices on some of Australia’s most popular cars”. The campaign used Facebook ad functionality to target users with an interest in particular vehicle types to make false claims about Labor’s 2019 policy. The Labor policy included vehicle emissions standards and a target of 50% of new car sales being electric vehicles by 2030. It did not include a tax on utility vehicles. While Morrison’s campaign comments and the context surrounding them remain on the public record, the prime minister bristled at Bowen’s question on Tuesday, declaring “the claim made by the questioner is false”. The prime minister later made a personal explanation to parliament. Having appeared to query his “end the weekend” quote earlier in question time, Morrison acknowledged he had said “Bill Shorten wants to end the weekend”. But he contended his criticism wasn’t about electric vehicles, it was about “Labor’s bad policy”. “The point about it is not whether electric vehicles are good or bad,” Morrison told parliament in his personal explanation. “In fact, they have a role to play increasingly in the vehicle fleet of Australia, over the next decade.” Since the Australian election, governments around the world have redoubled efforts to drive electrification of the vehicle fleet. The United States president, Joe Biden, last week foreshadowed an executive order which will attempt to make half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric, and the administration is pursuing new vehicle emissions standards.

He’s been signalling Australia wants to reach net zero emissions as soon as possible and “preferably” by 2050. But that shift has attracted pushback from the National party. Nationals senator Matt Canavan told reporters on Tuesday he “remained opposed” to a net zero target, claiming it would “send thousands of Australian jobs to other countries”. “I can’t see any way I would support a proposal that would not improve the environment but would cost our own jobs,” Canavan said. Earlier, in the Coalition party room, Nationals senator Sam McMahon announced a plan to seek to amend the EPBC Act to remove the prohibition on nuclear power, and potentially support taxpayer underwriting of plants, which received support from Canavan. The pair later told the media the policy had been agreed by Nationals senators, which Guardian Australia understands occurred before the recent change in leadership back to Barnaby Joyce. Canavan conceded the nuclear push is unlikely to receive the necessary support, although McMahon claimed colleagues including some Liberals had supported it “privately”. In New South Wales, the Liberal climate change minister, Matt Kean, meanwhile said Morrison needed to increase Australia’s ambition. “The federal government can do more,” he told the ABC. “I think you can set more ambitious targets.” Morrison often references the cost associated with action to reduce emissions. But Kean said the transition was an opportunity. He said Australia could be an “energy superpower in the low carbon economy that is coming”. “It will mean jobs, opportunity and prosperity for Australia.

Critics ask, is that leadership? ","The crucial UN climate talks in Scotland have produced landmark commitments to phase out coalmining, to call time on the internal combustion engines and to compensate poorer countries for damage caused by the climate crisis. The United States, which has trumpeted its regained climate leadership at the summit, has not joined any these pledges as the talks draw to a close. This disconnect has provided the world with a muddled sense of America’s willingness to confront the unfolding climate catastrophe, with the fate of historic legislation to lower planet-heating emissions still uncertain ahead of an expected vote in Congress next week. Joe Biden arrived in Glasgow vowing the US will “lead by example” on climate change and avoid disastrous global heating beyond 1.5C, dispatching his entire cabinet to the Cop26 talks and making widely praised new promises to cut methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and to end deforestation. Two dozen Democratic lawmakers wearing congressional lapel pins have swept the conference venue this week, all expressing confidence that the vast $1.75tn spending bill will pass back home. “This is the most ambitious climate legislation of all time,” Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, told the summit. “America is back and is ready to lead,” added Kathy Castor, chair of the House select committee on the climate crisis. “Once we pass this historic package, finally, it will help keep 1.5C alive.” But the US is bedeviled by its recent past and – many delegates of other countries fear – its potential future, following Donald Trump’s embrace of climate science denialism and American isolationism. “We have not recovered our moral authority,” admitted Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive New York representative, when asked about the specter of the former president. “I believe we are making steps, but we have to actually deliver the action in order to get the respect internationally. It’s that simple.” There is also mounting criticism that Biden’s actions have not matched his words and that the US president’s negotiators haven’t pushed hard enough for an ambitious deal in Glasgow to secure the deep emissions cuts needed to avoid disastrous warming that will spur ever-worsening floods, heatwaves and wildfires. More than 40 countries announced at Cop26 a promise to end the mining of coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels, although the US was conspicuously absent from the list. “It’s very disappointing because the science is quite clear that we have to turn sharply away from coal this decade if we are going to meet our climate goals,” said Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “We need very clear signals that orientate the US towards clean energy,” she added. “The climate crisis is too dire to just wait for coal to fall out. It’s just another signal of the sway the fossil fuel industry still has over US politics.” Despite its attempts to expand the rollout of electric vehicles, the Biden administration has also declined to set an end date for the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars, unlike the UK, European Union, Canada, India and a slew of other countries at Cop26. Its delegation in Glasgow is similarly wary of a push to provide “loss and damage” payments to countries vulnerable to climate impacts and has sought to shift criticism towards the inaction of China and Russia, although the US and China did unveil an unexpected plan to work together on cutting emissions, despite the enmity between the two countries. This reticence, critics claim, undermines Biden’s credibility on climate. Others say the dysfunctional nature of Congress, where sweeping climate legislation to expand renewable energy and wind down fossil fuels is effectively in the hands of a senator who derives most of his income from investments in coal, is to blame. “There is a handful of members of Congress who represent coal-intensive parts of the country who see [climate action] as a threat to their region,” Sean Casten, a Democratic representative, told the Guardian. “It’s kept the president from doing all that he’d like to do.” Pete Buttigieg, the US transport secretary, told the Guardian that the Biden administration aims to give Americans better public transit options, as well as electric vehicle rebates and infrastructure, but that “each country is on its own path” to ending the age of fossil fuel-powered cars. “What we are talking about is a race to the ambitious targets the president has set,” Buttigieg said, adding that the goal of half of all car sales being electric by 2030 will be in itself a “massive lift”. Biden will face further scrutiny almost immediately after some sort of deal is struck in Glasgow, not only over the fate of the Build Back Better bill but also his issuance of permits for oil and gas drilling. An auction of 80m acres of the Gulf of Mexico seabed, an area larger than the UK, will be offered to fossil fuel companies next week, while a new report has warned that the oil and gas that will be burned in the Permian Basin, a geological formation in the south-west US, by 2050 will release nearly 40bn tons of carbon dioxide, nearly a tenth of the remaining global “carbon budget” to stay under 1.5C. “If the Biden administration wants to be serious about its promise to demonstrate US climate leadership, it must first clean up its own back yard,” said Steven Feit, senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law. “The Permian Basin is the single largest fracking basin globally, and the continued reckless pursuit of oil extraction from New Mexico to the Gulf coast is the ultimate display of hypocrisy.”",0

Funding to replace coal- and gas-fired plants with wind, solar and nuclear generation was part of a massive budget bill that Biden is struggling to get through Congress. The New York Times reported that White House staff members are now rewriting the legislation without the $150bn clean energy provision, on the expectation that they will not be able to pass the original version because of staunch opposition from the West Virginia senator Joe Manchin. The news is the latest blow to hopes for the United Nations summit on climate change, Cop26, due to be held in Glasgow in two weeks’ time. China, the world’s top emitter of greenhouse gases, last week revealed plans to build more coal-fired power plants, and hinted it may be rethinking its timetable to cut emissions, as it struggles with an energy crisis amid slowing economic growth. It also seems increasingly clear that President Xi Jinping, China’s most powerful leader in many years, will not attend the Cop26 gathering. His absence will undermine hopes that dealmaking could get extra impetus from a personal gathering of leaders. For the Glasgow summit, which has been delayed by a year because of the pandemic, countries are expected to produce revised national emissions-cutting targets to help the world limit heating to 1.5C, the legally binding goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The UK presidency also hopes to focus on three other areas to meet climate goals: climate finance, phasing out coal, and nature-based solutions. Scientists estimate that emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, compared with 2010 levels, and from there to net zero emissions by 2050, if the world is to have a good chance of remaining within the threshold agreed in Paris. The UK and other major players have already accepted that they will not be able to win commitments for such sweeping cuts from big emitters at Glasgow, so instead London is focused on making enough progress to “keep 1.5C alive” as a potential goal. British diplomats say they are “cautiously optimistic” about overall progress, with a deal on providing $100bn to developing countries expected to be sealed and some advances on an agreement to halt deforestation and the destruction of nature. Last week more than 20 countries joined a pledge to cut methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The UK, the US and the EU have also embarked on a frantic round of climate diplomacy in a last-ditch attempt to bring key countries into a deal. But the latest news from the US and China, the world’s top emitters of greenhouse gases, will raise questions about how much progress the meeting can make towards core emissions goals. America is historically the world’s largest producer of greenhouse gasses and the US clean energy project was set to be the cornerstone of American efforts at Glasgow to push other countries to move faster on tackling climate change. Biden has called for urgent action on climate, in a definitive break with his predecessor Donald Trump, who rejected the international scientific consensus on a world heating up, and hobbled global efforts to do something about it. But if the president is forced to abandon the clean energy provision, it may damage international faith in Washington’s ability to turn rhetoric into domestic action on climate change. It would certainly make it harder for climate envoy John Kerry and his team to push other countries to make costly efforts to cut their own emissions. The electricity sector produces about a quarter of US greenhouse gases, and the infrastructure programme was meant to trigger a long-term shift in the country’s energy sector that would endure beyond Biden’s presidency. It proposed incentives for utilities to clean up their energy production and penalties for remaining reliant on fossil fuels. Manchin, who has said he strongly opposes the clean energy deal, has personal financial ties to the coal industry and represents a state where mining, although shrinking, still employs thousands of people.",4
environment/2021/sep/06/south-australia-avoids-universally-panned-victorian-electric-vehicle-user-charge-for-now,Environment,environment/2021/sep/06/south-australia-avoids-universally-panned-victorian-electric-vehicle-user-charge-for-now,The SA plan comes as manufacturers issue warning over ‘fractured’ Australian EV policy and call for states to scrap stamp duty on new vehicles,"South Australian treasurer Rob Lucas has defended his proposal for an electric vehicle user charge in the state as manufacturers warn a “fractured” national approach is only making a clean transition harder. Under the policy, which was announced in August, South Australia delayed introducing the user charge until 2027 or when EVs represent 30% of the market, and offered drivers a time-limited $3,000 subsidy on the purchase of a new electric vehicle. The policy attempts to thread the needle between the approach taken in Victoria that involved an immediate introduction of the charge – a move universally panned by industry and experts – while borrowing from New South Wales, which has proposed substantial incentives to support uptake. The South Australian government’s EV road-user charge has received the backing of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI) and consumer group the Royal Automobile Association. FCAI chief Tony Weber described the policy as very generous and said it avoided the worst aspects of the one adopted in Victoria. “You’ve got to look at the total package,” Weber said. “The New South Wales package is more generous but maybe SA can’t afford that.” Yet while the decision by South Australia to avoid following Victoria’s example has been universally welcomed, twelve vehicle manufacturers, industry associations and policy groups published an open letter on Monday calling on the state government to go further and scrap stamp duty. Among the signatories was Mitsubishi Motors Australia whose director of marketing and operations, Rob Nazzari said it was important to get the policy right from the start. “We remain concerned about the impact of the proposed tax on our customers,” Nazzari said. “We need to strike the right balance to ensure that the luxury end of the EV market is not incentivised at the expense of the increasingly popular and family-friendly PHEVs [plug-in hybrid electric vehicles] that will ultimately play a critical role in the low-carbon future for every-day South Australians.” Lucas said South Australia couldn’t afford to do more and the proposal by the government meant EV drivers would be paying less under the user charge than they are under the fuel excise. “There’s no magic money tree in all this,” Lucas said. “If ultimately you don’t have any funding coming in via a fuel excise or a road user charge for EVs, then there’s no money coming in for maintaining and upgrading roads.” Lucas added that the “inevitable” take up of EVs by Australians would force a change to the makeup of the federation. “If the states are now collecting the revenue the feds were previously collecting, a state government through the road user charge will have the capacity to establish its own priorities,” he said. However, Richie Merzian from The Australia Institute said this messaging confused the issue as fuel excise taxes do not directly pay for road construction or maintenance. “The fuel excise does not pay for roads. It stopped doing that in the fifties,” Merzian said. “We pay for roads like how we pay for hospitals, defence and schools: it comes out of the consolidated funds. Consolidated revenue that comes from GST, income tax, a whole variety for sources, which EV drivers already contribute to.” Merzian added that the South Australian proposal was the latest among a series that showed a “fractured” response by state and territory governments in the absence of federal leadership. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Volkswagen Group Australia managing director Michael Bartsch, who has been outspoken about the lack of support for transitioning Australia’s car fleet, said this lack of federal leadership means states can “go rogue”. “The states and territories are left to pursue individual policies on the most profound change to personal mobility in 100 years,” Bartsch said. “There is, of course, more to a mature EV policy than taxation or incentives.” Behyad Jafari from the Electric Vehicle Council said that without further work these policies will fail to properly introduce the new technology while actually reducing emissions. “It’s still a tax policy rather than an electric vehicle policy,” Jafari said. “It’s why we want to see a complete policy to support the transition. If you don’t get that now and the tax passes, when will the government work on it?”",3

That is the conclusion of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s 2021 economic survey of Australia, the first since the former finance minister Mathias Cormann took the helm in June. The OECD report also warned Australia remained vulnerable to shocks including escalation of its trade disputes with China, decline in fossil fuel demand, and carbon tariffs that might be imposed by trading partners. It called for Australia to consider less conventional monetary policy, raising unemployment benefits and greater cuts to greenhouse gas emissions as means to turbocharge recovery. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has seized on the report’s findings that Australia had a “well-coordinated” response to the pandemic including “macroeconomic policy support [that] was delivered swiftly and with appropriate force at the onset”. But the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the report was “yet another credible contribution pointing out that Australia’s economic weaknesses predated the pandemic, and that the recovery is hostage to the government’s failures on vaccines”. The OECD noted Australia’s vaccine rollout “started slowly but has picked up pace in recent months” and that parts of the country remain in lockdown despite a shift from a virus elimination to suppression approach. “OECD projections envisage annual output growth of 4% in 2021 and 3.3% in 2022,” it said, despite a certain contraction in the third quarter of 2021. It said risks and uncertainties “remain large”, with the potential for rapid recovery due to household savings being unleashed but the downside of Covid outbreaks in currently virus-free states. The OECD noted that Australia had shown “signs of structural headwinds when the pandemic hit” including that “productivity and wages growth had slowed notably”. “Over the longer-term, fiscal spending pressures will grow,” it said. “Under current policy settings, ageing related costs will cause public debt to rise to 2060. “In addition, further investment in the social safety net is needed, not least to complement reforms that promote business and labour market dynamism. For example, the unemployment benefit rate should be raised further.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The OECD noted the Morrison government had raised jobseeker by $50 a fortnight, but said at 29% of the average wage the benefit for a single person “is still very low by OECD standards”. The government should consider indexing jobseeker to wage inflation, it said. The OECD said Australia showed a “decline in environmental innovation over the past decade” and called for “stronger incentives for innovation and adoption of new low emission technologies”. It said a national carbon price “would be the most efficient means of achieving this” but due to “political considerations” Australia may need to scale up other market-based instruments, including the safeguard mechanism, a carbon offset system for large emitters. “This should be accompanied by policies that support the transition of workers out of fossil fuel generating industries.” The OECD report noted that imposition of carbon border adjustments – which are being considered by the European Union – could place “a carbon price on imports from less climate-ambitious countries” and have “significant impacts” on Australia’s trade-exposed sectors. It listed a decline in fossil fuel demand as a shock that would have “a large impact on the mining sector and related industries” particularly thermal coal exports to China, Japan and South Korea, which are all aiming for net zero emissions.

In campaigning for the job, Cormann talked up the importance of a “collective green recovery” despite being part of the Abbott government that abolished Australia’s carbon price – incorrectly characterised as a tax – in 2014. Scott Morrison wants to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner if possible, but is yet to persuade the junior Coalition partner, the Nationals, to make this government policy and allow him to take it to Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow in November. Chalmers said Australia’s economy would “be much stronger if it wasn’t shedding billions of dollars a week as a consequence of the Morrison government’s inability to get vaccines and quarantine right”. “That’s the price Australians are paying for Scott Morrison’s mistakes.” Frydenberg noted the OECD survey found a “substantial quickening in the pace of the vaccine rollout”. “With more than 43% of Australians fully vaccinated, progress towards our nationally agreed targets of 70 to 80% is accelerating,” Frydenberg said in a statement. As the survey notes, once we reach these targets, “the reopening of international borders will support the economic recovery through enabling foreign student arrivals, bilateral tourism and population growth stemming from net immigration”.",10
us-news/2021/mar/31/biden-infrastructure-plan-address-climate-crisis,Environment,us-news/2021/mar/31/biden-infrastructure-plan-address-climate-crisis,President says new plan will allow ‘transformational progress’ by bolstering investments in clean energy and electric vehicles,"Joe Biden has said his new infrastructure plan will allow “transformational progress in our ability to tackle climate change” by bolstering investments in clean energy, electric vehicles and building homes resilient to threats posed by the climate crisis. The $2tn plan will make “crumbling” American infrastructure more robust to extreme weather events, the US president said in a speech on Wednesday, while providing funds to “build a modern, resilient and fully clean grid”. Biden said that tax incentives should allow “all Americans to afford clean electric vehicles” and workers will be able to “seize amazing opportunities in a clean energy future”. Biden opened his White House term with a cavalcade of executive actions to begin the gargantuan task of shifting the US to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and the new $2tn package, known as the American Jobs Plan, is the first indication of the scale of spending that will be required to reshape day-to-day life in order to avert disastrous climate change. As well as huge investments in crumbling roads and bridges, the Biden plan takes aim at the emissions created by transport, currently the country’s largest source of planet-heating gases. There’s $80bn for Amtrak and freight rail, $85bn for public transit, $174bn to promote electric vehicles through various incentives, the electrification of school buses and 500,000 new plug-in recharging stations within the next decade. The federal government’s vehicle fleet will also be electrified. Ports and airports will be upgraded, the plan states, while more than $200bn is proposed to build, modernize and fortify housing for low-income people affected by the storms, heatwaves and wildfires of growing intensity that are upending American lives and threatening billions, if not trillions, of dollars in ongoing damages. A further $100bn will be spent upgrading an electricity grid vulnerable to the sort of climate shocks that recently shook Texas, as well as aiding the transmission of a glut of new renewable energy. In all, 40% of this spending will be aimed at vulnerable communities of color. The scale of the investment, even in the wake of the giant Covid relief bill, is striking. Biden made clear in his speech on Wednesday that this is the point when the US “finally address the climate crisis as a nation”, according to an administration official. “There’s a lot to like in this plan, it’s excellent in almost every way,” said Julio Friedmann, who was a climate and energy adviser in Barack Obama’s administration and is now an energy researcher at Columbia University. “This is a generational commitment and it can only be applauded. The $2tn is half the price tag of World War Two, it exceeds the scale of the New Deal, it’s wildly larger than the Marshall Plan – and appropriately so. This is the hardest thing we’ve ever done. People generally don’t understand how much construction and reduction is required.” But even the administration’s allies concede further, longer-term spurs to remodel the economy and alter behavior will be required on top of this plan. The package includes a major boost to clean energy research and development, as well as a proposal for a clean electricity standard – a mandate for utilities to phase out fossil fuels use across the grid to zero over the next 15 years that Friedmann said will be a “vital” element of eliminating planet-hearting emissions. But these measures will, like the new spending, require congressional support that is far from guaranteed. Republicans have recoiled from Biden’s idea of raising corporate tax rates to help pay for the investments, with Mitch McConnell, the GOP’s Senate leader, calling the plan a “Trojan horse” for climate measures the party doesn’t support. “In an ideal world this plan would be part of a set of policies to lower emissions but with American politics it’s not clear the rest of it will happen,” said David Popp, a climate policy expert at Syracuse University. “Infrastructure alone won’t get you to net zero emissions. The hope is that you build a green economy to the point where emissions reduction mandates become more doable.” Progressives, meanwhile, have complained that Biden’s plan does not meet the scale of the climate crisis. “Needs to be way bigger,” tweeted Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic representative from New York. Ocasio-Cortez and her allies back an alternative $10tn plan, called the Thrive Act, that proponents say would create 15m new jobs and cut emissions in half by the end of the decade. Rallies are set to be held across the US on Wednesday by climate activists who support this plan. Communities of color, which often suffer the brunt of the climate crisis, helped elect Biden and “it’s time to make sure that our government delivers a real recovery that recognizes the harsh reality our communities continue to face on the ground,” according to Elizabeth Yeampierre, co-chair of the Climate Justice Alliance. “We’ve had enough excuses, enough delays.” The Biden plan is a “big opening gambit, a big down payment, but it’s not the totality required,” said Friedmann. “It focuses on what’s actionable quickly that yields big emissions abatement. I would like more too, but it’s easy to throw rocks from the outside. It’s a great start but, yes, we will ultimately need more. For the next 30 years, every week is infrastructure week.”",8
business/2021/apr/17/townsvilles-road-to-paris-moment-the-slow-greening-of-an-adani-stronghold,Business,business/2021/apr/17/townsvilles-road-to-paris-moment-the-slow-greening-of-an-adani-stronghold,"After years of a ‘coal-first’ mentality, the Queensland town is starting to see a future for itself as a green-energy powerhouse","“Adani was about the here and now for the community,” says Townsville’s mayor, Jenny Hill, reflecting on a decade spent championing the thermal coal project as a way to reduce the city’s high unemployment rate. “There were no jobs. There was no interest in manufacturing. It was important to give the community hope for the future.” Townsville’s place at the forefront of the coal wars have made Hill, who is a member of the ALP, a prominent figure in the party’s schism over coal and climate. In 2019 she told a forum run by Labor’s Chifley Research Centre that the city’s mantra was “we stick to our guns: we support mining”. It is remarkable, then, that Hill now says clean energy – and not thermal coal – will be at the forefront of Townsville’s future economy. “If you’re smart in politics you’ve got to deal with the short term, but you’ve got to deal with the long term as well,” Hill tells Guardian Australia. “The market will eventually decide what happens with thermal coal and where it ends up. The Japanese have put it out there on public record they are going to cut their thermal coal imports. “Economies [like South Korea and Japan] want clean energy and that means green hydrogen. We’re in a position to be able to deliver.” Some locals in Townsville described the subtle but significant shift in language from community and business leaders as a “road to Paris conversion” – a pivot brought about by rapidly changing international sentiment and declining prospects for coal. Hill doesn’t directly acknowledge a suggestion that the ground has shifted from a point a few years ago when she described Adani to the writer Anna Krien as “the only next big thing”. But she now speaks with zeal about the sorts of transition opportunities that might be created in a place where the port could link Queensland’s rare earth mineral deposits with the world; and where refining and manufacturing is already being fuelled by the city’s 320 days of annual sunlight. Townsville is developing an eco-industrial precinct with plans for a solar microgrid to power battery manufacturing, a nickel refinery and other industries. This week the port of Townsville signed a memorandum of understanding with energy company Origin to export green hydrogen, which could be produced locally with non-potable water and solar power. “The scientist in me sees it as a pilot study,” Hill said. “I will always support mining, but it doesn’t mean we can’t take advantage of these new technologies and bring manufacturing back into this country. “This is about reimagining the economy for my community and building it. If it works here, it can help ensure we get growth.” Last month Solar Citizens, a lobby group for solar owners and renewables supporters, released a report detailing how Townsville could become a renewable energy “powerhouse”, creating 11,000 jobs – equivalent to 10% of the city’s total workforce. Proposed manufacturing and industry projects powered by renewables could be worth $154bn over their lifetime, the report found. The city already has a company spearheading the transition: the Korea Zinc-owned refiner SunMetals, one of Queensland’s biggest energy consumers, and the first power-intensive facility in Australia to build its own solar farm. The Townsville council and its regional business lobby, Townsville Enterprise, are heavily promoting plans to build an “eco-industrial precinct” at Lansdown, which would run on a renewable micro-grid and could include a battery manufacturing plant, refineries and other green industry businesses. In Queensland politics, “transition” has been a dirty word. Pro-coal politicians like LNP senator Matt Canavan have said transition equates to job destruction. Rightwing media commentators have portrayed comments that miners need to “re-skill” as a kind of ideological warfare, rather than part of a discussion about how communities respond to a real global shift away from fossil fuels. “It’s the right of the workers in the community not to be destroyed in the process of the transition,” Tim Buckley, the director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, says. “And now the opportunities [from transition] are starting to become tangible and real.” Sean Cochrane, who runs renewable business SuperGreen Solutions in Townsville, says the conversation had clearly shifted in the city now people could see genuine opportunity from the energy transition. “A year ago it was all we need coal jobs, we need coal jobs,” Cochrane says. “There was never another argument, another source of jobs. I don’t think Townsville is the backwater that sometimes people in the south think it is. Townsville has come of age. People are looking for intelligent solutions.” Joseph O’Brien, the managing director of a Townsville company proposing to build Copperstring 2.0 – a project that would connect the North West Minerals Province to the national energy grid – says there are significant opportunities for the city. “I believe the real message here is that it’s not about what Townsville shouldn’t do, but what Townsville does as a global leader, and that’s advanced industrial manufacturing and minerals processing,” O’Brien said. “This pedigree in industrial manufacturing can be an enormous job creator and it’s also an enormous creator of expertise that will be very valuable for the region and for Australia too. “Townsville is an entrepreneurial and pragmatic place, it doesn’t have the luxury of choosing where it wants to get its jobs from. Regional centres need to play to their strengths and respond to global opportunities and for Townsville the global opportunities make for a very bright future.” After Townsville flooded in early 2019, residents in the low-lying suburb of Hermit Park brought out their dead appliances and mud-logged possessions and piled them up at the roadside. Guardian Australia asked a handful of locals there about climate change. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, had just called the flooding “unprecedented”. Experts overwhelmingly believe the climate is fuelling more extreme weather events. “If anyone mentions [climate change] I’ll punch ’em,” a local, Mark Parison, said immediately after the floods. “These people crying about climate change, they’ve got to look at how they live themselves. They’re still driving around in cars, they’re still wearing nice clothes. They’re using mobile phones. So give that up, I’ll start listening to you. “City people are stalling us. We need the economy here to be boosted.” So, for several years, has gone much of the debate in Townsville about coal and climate change. Kitchen table concerns come first. Even if your kitchen table is literally floating away. Elements of that fraught debate remain a reality in north Queensland, even as the opportunities of a green energy future move from concept towards reality. Few are ready to completely eschew the coal industry or its prospects to provide jobs for locals. “Whilst an eye must certainly be kept on the future, we cannot stop investing and supporting the existing industries that have been the backbone of our nation’s economy for generations,” says Wade Chiesa, the regional development and investment director of Townsville Enterprise. Chiesa highlights efforts to create new industries, but says north Queensland’s strengths remain “the natural resources sitting in our backyard and our capacity to generate energy”. “Off the back of 12 months of Covid-19 support measures from state and federal governments, the royalties generated by our mining and resources industry are more important than ever as we claw back from the largest debt we have ever experienced. “As of early this year, Bravus (Adani) had signed $2.2bn in contracts to build the Carmichael mine and rail project and in under two years since the project was greenlighted by the state government the company has employed more than 2,000 people. “Now is the time we need sustained jobs to support families, not a time to erase them.” Hill says the closure of Clive Palmer’s Queensland Nickel refinery was “a massive shock” to the northern port city, which was Australia’s first “solar city” back in 2007. “Adani [became] the face of everything because the community desperately needed jobs,” she says. “You don’t want your city to die. We had 13% unemployment. We have long-term aspirations but there’s a short-term need. “When you go doorknocking you see people who are barely making ends meet and are desperate for a job that is barely a living wage. Many tourism jobs are low-paying jobs, you can’t go into a bank and get a home loan with some of those jobs. When you’re in the mining sector you can.” Now, Hill says advanced manufacturing powered by renewables offers another prospect for well-paid work – and that the city will embrace its opportunity. “The key for me and the council is to show the community that we can get this right in Townsville. We can use renewables to power industry at a far cheaper rate than pulling power off the grid. “We’re hopeful for long-term jobs for our community.”",9

In an explicit response to the government’s “technology, not taxes” approach to reducing emissions, the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering has released a position statement calling on the government to “prioritise the immediate deployment of existing mature, low-carbon technologies which can make deep cuts to high-emitting sectors before 2030”. The academy has also urged the government to set a more ambitious emissions target for 2030 ahead of the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, following calls by diplomats, scientists, business leaders, and backbench Coalition MPs Warren Entsch and Jason Falinski. The academy’s president, Prof Hugh Bradlow, said “the technologies we can use to actually make significant progress are here today”. “We don’t have to take risks and their economics are proven,” he said. “It’s not a case of … waiting for some miracle to happen. It’s a case of getting on with it now.” Bradlow said setting a target of net zero emissions by 2050 – as most business and industry groups, all the states and more than 100 national governments have – was an “unequivocal requirement” that countries should meet. “Most countries are stepping up to recognise that requirement, and without that sort of commitment you don’t take the actions that you need in order to get there,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Prof Renate Egan of the University of New South Wales, a member of the academy’s energy forum working group, said existing technologies – including solar and wind power, energy storage, electric vehicles and energy efficiency for buildings – could rapidly reduce emissions in the electricity, stationary energy and transport sectors. Egan said electricity, which accounts for about a third of Australia’s emissions, was already on track to be 80% renewably generated by 2030. But she said while large emissions reductions could be achieved using existing technology, reaching net zero would require investment in new technologies such as “clean” hydrogen and greener processes for manufacturing aluminium and steel. The Morrison government has emphasised the latter, promising to support five priority areas – also including carbon capture and storage, and soil carbon – under a low-emissions technology statement released last year. It is under rising pressure to do more to reduce emissions in the short term. An Australian Conservation Foundation survey of 15,000 people released this week found a majority of people in every federal electorate believed the Morrison government should be doing more to tackle the climate crisis. Entsch and Falinski both called for the 2030 emissions target to be increased beyond the government’s six-year-old commitment of a 26-28% cut compared with 2005 levels. On Wednesday, Falinski tweeted that the government should commit to reaching net zero by 2050 and set a new “stretch target” for 2030. Entsch said he had been lobbying his senior colleagues to commit to “stronger interim emissions reduction commitments”. But some Nationals MPs remain strongly opposed to greater climate action, and Morrison has resisted calls to join the US, European Union, UK, Japan and Canada in significantly increasing 2030 goals, and the more than 100 countries that have set a mid-century net zero target. He has promised a long-term emissions strategy before the Glasgow summit in November. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, last week told Guardian Australia “progress is being made behind closed doors” within the government on climate change, but said he was “very comfortable” with the 2030 target. Dr John Söderbaum, chair of the technology and engineering academy’s energy forum, said Australia needed a net zero policy and clear framework if the country was “to have any sort of realistic hope of reaching net zero by 2050”. “This is not anything controversial: state and territory governments, businesses, industry associations have already adopted such targets and are calling for them,” he said. “We have lost a lot of time. We could have been much further down the path if we had had a more planned and structured approach to reducing our emissions.” The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, on Wednesday painted the climate crisis as one of the most significant security challenges of the 21st century, and accused the Morrison government of failing to rise to that reality. A group of retired defence force personnel stressed this point in a report to be released on Thursday, saying government inaction on climate change meant it was failing in its duty to protect Australians. The Australian Security Leaders Climate Group, which includes retired defence figures such as Admiral Chris Barrie, Air Vice-Marshal John Blackburn and Colonel Neil Greet, called on the government to change its approach to climate change “as a matter of urgency”. Its report said the politicisation of climate change had “paralysed” government departments, and called on the public service to “reestablish a ‘frank and fearless’ voice on climate policy choices”. “The capacity of the Australian Public Service (APS) to provide advice on climate issues has been diminished,” it said. “Former APS personnel report experiences in which initiating new work on climate change could not be overtly identified as climate focused because that may lead to the project being closed down.” The group pointed to Australia’s catastrophic 2019-20 bushfires, when soldiers were mobilised to fire-ravaged regional areas. It called for the development of holistic policies to prepare for and prevent climate-related security risks, including protecting the country’s “precarious” global supply chains. “In an emergency [in which] supply chains are disrupted, domestic oil and petrol supplies would last only weeks and military capacity to move and fly would be compromised,” it warned. The latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published earlier this month, found emissions were already affecting weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe, contributing to an increase in heatwaves, heavier rainfall events and more intense droughts and tropical cyclones. In Australia, average temperatures above land have increased by about 1.4C since 1910.",2
environment/2021/nov/04/dark-secrets-big-oil-climate-pledges-greenwashing,Environment,environment/2021/nov/04/dark-secrets-big-oil-climate-pledges-greenwashing,Oil companies and the banks that finance them are making empty promises – and getting credit for them too,"JPMorgan Chase won glowing headlines last year when the global investment bank unveiled a commitment to counter the climate crisis. The press amplified JPMorgan’s message – sometimes in JPMorgan’s own words. Fortune published a commentary article trumpeting the bank’s plans to “tackle climate change”. Six paragraphs into the piece, the writers noted they worked for the investment firm. (They were actually its top executives.) The bank waited months to detail its plans. In May, it finally outlined its goals: JPMorgan would not pressure oil companies to lower their emissions. Instead, the firm would encourage them to become more efficient. They would focus on their “carbon intensity”. That metric has become a favorite of banks, oil companies and other big businesses. They’ve balked at requirements to cut overall climate pollution. But “carbon intensity” pledges have given companies a framework to keep investing in dirty fuels, while also expanding into pollution-capturing technology and cleaner energy. “They love the metric,” said Jeanne Martin, senior manager of banking standards at ShareAction, a non-profit focused on responsible investment. “They have committed to reducing intensity and financing to the oil and gas sector. But that doesn’t ultimately mean they will reduce oil and gas activities. It may actually increase at a faster rate.” Such “greenwashing”, experts say, allows companies to downplay the scale of the climate crisis – and continue contributing to the problem.  Greenwashing is a form of marketing spin, in which companies persuade the public that their products, aims and policies are environmentally friendly. The term was coined by environmentalist Jay Westerveld in 1986 to refer to the corporate practice of making sustainability claims to cover a questionable environmental record. An absolute greenhouse gas emissions target aims to reduce overall climate pollution by a specific amount.  A net-zero goal is meant to offset all greenhouse gas emissions by  capturing them, planting trees to absorb them, or paying for the development of cleaner energy.  An intensity reduction seeks to cut the rate of planet-heating emissions that accompanies each unit of energy produced. “It’s the next five or 10 years that will determine our collective futures,” said Andrew Logan, oil and gas director at Ceres, the non-profit that advocates for corporate sustainability. “It’s probably safe to say that there is no company – certainly in the financial sector, or heavy-emitting sectors – that has a fully defensible plan when it comes to meeting the scale and scope of the urgency of the climate challenge.” World leaders are starting to find the gap between corporate rhetoric and action too glaring to ignore. Historically, oil and gas companies have been top sponsors at international climate meetings, hosting events and prominently displaying advertisements with their climate goals. That is beginning to shift. The UK, host of this week’s landmark climate summit in Glasgow, will limit participation by companies unless they have a “credible short-term action plan” to ratchet down emissions. But in the run-up to this year’s negotiations, oil companies are blitzing social media with advertisements about their climate pledges. In a Facebook ad campaign launched this month, ExxonMobil promises to cut pollution from drilling. It plans to do that by reducing emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas much more potent than carbon over the short term. That will lower the “methane intensity” of its operations – but it ignores the emissions from customers burning the fuel itself. “The fossil fuel companies feel the heat and feel the pressure to do something about this, if they want to remain the main provider of energy,” said Yamide Dagnet, the director of climate negotiations at World Resources Institute. Royal Dutch Shell announced last week it will cut its absolute carbon emissions in half by 2030. But the commitment pertains only to the company’s internal climate footprint, not the much larger share of emissions that occur when its fuels are burned for energy. The timing of the announcement is also notable, as it comes on the heels of a Dutch court ruling earlier this year that Shell must slash its emissions 45% by 2030. Most other fossil fuel companies – and the banks that finance them – continue to find alternatives to promising outright emissions reductions. A net zero goal signals a company aims to offset its emissions by adding cleaner energy projects to their portfolios, or attempting to capture carbon dioxide and stop it from entering the air. But these goals can be so narrow as to be meaningless. Beau O’Sullivan, senior communications campaigner at the global social activist group Sunrise Project*, said fossil fuel companies were “inoculating themselves from bank and shareholder pressure by making these net zero commitments”. BP has the most aggressive decarbonization plans in the sector, according to an analysis by the global energy research and consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie. The company aims to be net zero for its operations and upstream production by 2050 and to halve its carbon intensity by then. It has slashed its budget for oil exploration, and it’s the only oil giant that has promised to cut production over the next decade. But the devil is in the details – or the lack thereof. BP declined to comment on why it has excluded a large portion of its emissions in its net zero commitment, choosing not to calculate emissions from its more than 20% stake in the Russian company Rosneft. Rosneft explores for oil and gas in some of the most remote regions, including in ecologically vulnerable Siberia and the Arctic. The company’s lobbying also conflicts with its climate message. In 2020, BP left three associations because of their climate positions. But it is still a member of the American Petroleum Institute, which has lobbied against electric vehicle tax breaks, methane regulations and drilling restrictions in the Arctic. BP in a March 2021 report said it is working with API and other associations to move “on important issues such as support for the Paris Agreement, regulation of methane, carbon pricing and the role of climate science”. Congrats @ProcterGamble on your net zero announcement! It’ll take all of us, greening companies in every sector, to tackle climate change. Here's what we mean by greening companies: https://t.co/rO5dVyZoo6"" https://t.co/2lu9qKFouE These greenwashing campaigns benefit more than just the oil companies. Banks are increasingly under pressure to drop their financing of fossil fuels. To defend their continued investments, they’re pointing at oil companies’ climate pledges. “We’re now at a point where the very largest investors in the world, the investors who are the biggest shareholders in high-emitting companies, see climate change as a real threat to the financial health of whole sectors,” said Miguel Jaller, the vice-chair of the department of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis. Jaller was the lead author on a white paper that found intensity targets can play a role in emissions reductions, but aren’t a one-size-fits-all tool. “Ultimately, climate change is an absolute problem that requires absolute reductions in emissions,” Jaller said. Banks have begun to commit to shrink the carbon footprint of their own operations, including from powering their office buildings. But their biggest contributions to global heating are in the oil and gas companies they finance. Few have weaved in climate commitments with their financing strategies, although they are beginning to now. The world’s 60 largest banks financed nearly $4tn in fossil fuel projects between 2016 and 2020, according to a March report from a coalition of climate organizations including the Rainforest Action Network (RAN), Sierra Club, BankTrack and more. That total includes lending, equity issuance and debt underwriting. JPMorgan is the largest financier of oil and gas projects in the world, according to the report. The US-based bank poured $51bn into the sector just in 2020. JPMorgan announced in May of this year that it would revise its lending portfolio to be more sustainable. “We are the first large US bank to lay out concrete targets that help meet the goals of Paris – climate change is a critical issue and we want to be part of the solution, advancing sustainable and inclusive growth,” a spokesperson for JP Morgan said in a statement. But JP Morgan’s benchmark is built around carbon intensity. The bank could finance more drilling without breaking its pledge. The bank wants oil and gas companies to cut their operations emissions intensity 35%. It’s asking for much less from their oil and gas products – like natural gas for electricity and oil that is turned into gasoline for vehicles. For those, the bank wants a 15% reduction in intensity by 2030. JPMorgan has said it will “work with clients to address end-use emissions, including by shifting to lower-carbon fuels and exploring other business diversification strategies.” The main lower-carbon fuel is natural gas. If a fossil fuel company increases natural gas production enough, it could offset its emissions progress. It could keep its intensity metric lower while still increasing its overall emissions. “They really took a page out of the oil industry book, when it comes to talking about their goals,” said Jackie Fielder, digital and communications coordinator at Stop the Money Pipeline, a coalition committed to ending the financing of fossil fuel companies. “They talked in terms of carbon intensity. So that’s completely compatible with increased emissions.” On the ground, JP Morgan’s financing has powered some of the most controversial fossil fuel projects. It funded TC Energy’s Coastal GasLink, a fracked-gas pipeline that in 2020 leaked in Wet’suwet’en Territory. It also financed Cheniere’s Corpus Christi natural gas export facility, as well as Enbridge, which is building the Line 3 pipeline. A JP Morgan spokesperson said the bank focuses on helping clients “transition to the low-carbon world”, and supports climate policies like a carbon tax. But, the spokesperson added, the bank believes the world still needs oil and gas. “The solution is not as simple as walking away from fossil fuels,” the bank’s spokesperson said. *Sunrise Project is a Floodlight supporter.",2
environment/2021/may/26/seven-in-10-australians-want-government-to-take-more-action-on-climate-survey-finds,Environment,environment/2021/may/26/seven-in-10-australians-want-government-to-take-more-action-on-climate-survey-finds,The Lowy Institute’s annual survey of sentiment on climate action found strong support for net zero emissions by 2050 and a ban on new coalmines,"The Morrison government is under increasing pressure to act on the climate crisis, with a new poll showing seven in 10 Australians want the Coalition to lock in stronger commitments in the lead-up to this year’s Glasgow summit. The Lowy Institute’s annual survey of sentiment on climate action finds strong domestic support for Australia committing to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and majority support for a ban on new coalmines. The findings appear to undercut resistance from some prominent members of the Nationals, who have publicly cautioned the government against making a net zero commitment and have been pushing for a continued embrace of coal. The Lowy Institute-commissioned poll of 3,286 Australians found overall concern about climate change had increased over the past year, with 60% of respondents describing global warming as “a serious and pressing problem” and agreeing “we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs”. That represented a four-point increase from 2020. In the latest climate poll, a majority (55%) also said the government’s main priority for energy policy should be “reducing carbon emissions” – an eight percentage point increase since 2019. That compares with 32% of the sample who said the priority should be reducing household bills – a decline of six points over the same period. Reducing the risk of power blackouts – a key focus of the government’s messaging on the issue – was nominated by just 12% of respondents as the energy policy priority in the most recent poll, down three points. With the government facing international pressure to endorse deeper emission cuts in the lead-up to the expanded G7 summit in June and the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, the poll finds strong domestic support for doing so. When presented with a question about the forthcoming UN climate negotiations, 70% agreed that “Australia should join other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, to increase its commitments to address climate change”. That compared with about three in 10 respondents (29%) who chose the alternative statement that “Australia should continue with its current policies to address climate change”, while 1% said they did not know. Some 78% of those surveyed said they would support a net zero emissions target by 2050 – an idea Scott Morrison has expressed as a “preference” rather than a formal commitment – while 20% said they would oppose it. Just over six in 10 Australians said they would support a ban on new coalmines opening in Australia, while the same proportion said they would support reducing Australian coal exports to other countries. Just 30% of the sample would support providing subsidies for building new coal-fired power plants. The director of the Lowy Institute’s public opinion and foreign policy program, Natasha Kassam, said the politics and economics of climate action were shifting and a number of elected officials “would take heart” from the results. Kassam said the level of support for moving away from coal would not have been seen several years ago. She noted that 70% of Australia’s coal and gas exports went to countries in Asia that had set net zero commitments. “We’ve seen Australians’ concern about the climate increase since 2012,” she said, while noting there had been a slight dip in the poll last year when “understandably much of the public was feeling pretty anxious about the pandemic”. “What has really shifted in the last couple of years is the willingness of the public to bear costs for climate action … and now we can see the vast majority accept benefits outweigh the costs.” When asked to weigh the consequences of acting on climate change, nearly three-quarters of the respondents (74%) said the benefits of taking further action would outweigh the costs, while about a quarter (24%) said the costs would outweigh the benefits. Other popular potential policies include providing subsidies for the development of renewable energy technologies (91% support) and providing subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles (77%). With the government pursuing its so-called “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic, and planning to spend up to $600m on a new gas-fired power plant in New South Wales, 58% of the sample said they would support increasing the use of gas for Australia’s energy generation. And seven years after the Abbott government repealed the Gillard government’s carbon price after a relentless political campaign, some 64% of the sample said they would support an emissions trading scheme or a carbon tax. The Lowy Institute said its climate poll was based on a nationally representative online and telephone survey conducted by the Social Research Centre between 12 and 26 April, with a margin of error of about 1.8%. The Sydney-based thinktank has been tracking attitudes to global warming since 2006, when 68% of respondents agreed that it was “a serious and pressing problem” requiring Australia to take steps even if it involved costs. That dropped to a low of 36% in 2012 at the height of the acrimonious political battle over the Gillard government’s carbon pricing scheme, before steadily rising in subsequent years.",1

In the early 1970s the world’s biggest sand island – an ethereal paradise of lakes, towering rainforests and ancient dunes – was under pressure from sand mining and more than a century of logging. By 1976, Sinclair and his purpose-built Fraser Island Defenders Organisation (Fido) had fought off the sand miners. It took another 15 years for the logging to stop. But in the years before he died, there was another threat to the island’s future that Sinclair was worried about. Climate change. Two months ago, an illegal campfire on the island got out of control. With drier than usual conditions and high temperatures, the blaze has so far scorched 85,000 hectares – more than half the island. What would John Sinclair have made of the devastation? “He’d probably have said: I told you this would happen,” his son Keith tells the Guardian. “He’d say: What are we going to do to make sure it won’t happen again?” After logging ended, the island was inscribed as a United Nations world heritage site in 1992. “When the logging stopped I said to dad that we’d won,” Keith Sinclair says. “He said we hadn’t, because now the island would be loved to death.” Fire has always been a feature of the island’s landscape, and many species have evolved to exist with fire. The Butchulla Aboriginal people have lived on the island for thousands of years and traditionally carried out cool patch burns to promote biodiversity and reduce the risk of larger fires. Europeans and loggers arrived in the mid-19th century. The Butchulla people were dispersed, put in missions and, in at least one documented case from 1851, massacred. Thousands of years of fire management ended and the island’s susceptibility to fire – known as the fire regime – changed. At the same time, the island’s ecology was being affected by logging and sand mining. Peter Shooter, the current president of Fido, says the organisation fought strongly in the 70s and 80s for a future based not on extraction and destruction, but on eco-tourism. “We were laughed out of town by supporters of the mining and logging industries all the way through that,” says Shooter. “The tourism industry has grown huge, and with that industry comes impact.” Earlier this month, the International Union for Conservation of Nature released its latest outlook report for K’gari, as the island is called in local language. Among the many threats facing the island, it reported, were disturbances from the many thousands of 4WD vehicles that drive along the island’s beaches and along sand tracks, and from the hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Shooter says: “Fido finds itself in a position where we advocated for a shift in the island’s economy and now we have to live with the consequences.” A Queensland government statement said about 600,000 people visit the island each year and more than $10m was budgeted annually for management activities “including maintaining and improving visitor infrastructure and education messaging aimed at protecting and presenting the island’s world heritage values”. Four full-time Butchulla land and sea rangers were funded and who undertook planned cultural burns, the statement said. K’gari covers 160,000 hectares, with 250km (155 miles) of beaches. Dingoes move through beaches, dunes and forests, birds of prey and shorebirds survey the coastlines and the dense rainforests, creeks and banks are home to lizards and small marsupial mammals. Half the world’s freshwater dune lakes are on K’gari. The island’s towering 50m rainforest trees on the top of coastal dunes are thought to be unique globally. “They are the most spectacular and complex series of coastal dunes in the world and they have a history going back 800,000 years,” says Prof Jamie Shulmeister, who has studied the long history of the island’s sand dunes. Shulmeister, who moved from the University of Queensland to New Zealand’s University of Canterbury in February, most recently chaired the K’gari world heritage scientific advisory committee, which is currently being reconstituted. “[The dunes] go inland and individual dunes can be five or 10 kilometres long and several hundred metres high. “Coastlines are really dynamic places and it’s unusual to have dunes that keep reforming in the same place at the same time.” The island’s heathlands and eucalypt forests give way to spectacular rainforests through the middle of the island, where trees more than 1,000 years old tower above crystal clear creeks. Shulmeister says those rainforest ecosystems existed because the dunes had been in the same place for so long. But the IUCN outlook report says climate change is an emerging threat to the island’s unique features that were the basis for its world heritage listing. “Climate change seems to be irreversibly changing some of the physical properties of the site and has already been demonstrated as a threat to several site values,” the review says. Increasing temperatures were threatening some plant species, rising sea levels could erode the dunes, and worsening droughts, more intense rainfall and bushfires are all lining up to put further pressure on the island’s ecology. Myrtle rust – an invasive plant disease – is also well established on the island, affecting melaleuca swamps and fringing rainforest trees. In August, bushfire experts issued an outlook for Australia. Most of the country faced a normal level of risk from fire, but the south-east of Queensland – including K’gari – was predicted to be at higher risk because of low rainfall over the past two years. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has ordered a broad review into the fire. At the peak of the firefight, 14 water-bombing aircraft were being used daily, with 90 firefighters from the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, Queensland Parks and Wildlife service and the Butchulla Aboriginal Corporation. Firefighters are hopeful that heavy rainfall forecast for several days from Saturday could finally put the blaze out. Shulmeister says fires have been getting larger and burning hotter in recent decades than at any time during European habitation. “They become a threat to the ecosystems and the plants and animals. I’m dismayed by the size and scale [of the latest fire],” he says. Many of the island’s ecosystems are adapted to cope with some fire, but it will be some time before ecologists know how the scale and intensity of the fire affects the recovery. “If we get a period where the island can recover then it might not be such a big deal,” Shulmeister says. “But if in one or two years there’s follow-up fires, you will see erosion of the sand dunes and that could be a major change on the island. “This could be an event that triggers major sand movement, but we won’t know until it’s in the rear vision mirror. It’s big enough that this could be the start of something dramatic.” Keith Sinclair’s grandparents had their honeymoon on the island in 1935 and built a house near Eurong on K’gari in the 1960s. Sinclair’s childhood memories are filled with long K’gari days, and he still visits several times a year, taking his own two children. “What terrifies me is the extent of the fire,” he says. “The animals can’t escape.” Fido has built a series of small weather stations around the island because Sinclair says his father was convinced the island was drying out. Shooter says Fido wants more done to mitigate the damage being caused by visitors, and has even proposed a light rail line to take in key locations and to reduce the pressure from 4WDs. Shooter believes the duration and size of the fire is unprecedented, but whether climate change was a factor he can’t say definitively. “These are matters for international action and we all suffer the consequences unless all of humanity plays its part. There’s very little Fido can do, but we’re in this and we’ll be making representation to the Australian government to lift its act.”",1
environment/2021/oct/21/kathy-castor-interview-climate-crisis-democrats,Environment,environment/2021/oct/21/kathy-castor-interview-climate-crisis-democrats,Democrat Kathy Castor warns that even Biden’s ambitious Build Back Better bill ‘doesn’t really get us to net zero by 2050’,"The alarm bells are ringing. A code red has been declared. With no less than the future of the planet at stake, Kathy Castor, chair of the select committee on the climate crisis, has warned Democrats that there is precious little time left to enact the US president’s aggressive climate agenda and avert the most catastrophic impacts of global warming. “We just don’t have any more time to waste,” the Florida congresswoman said in an interview with the Guardian ahead of crucial UN climate talks in Scotland. “We have got to act now or else we’re condemning our children and future generations to a really horrendous time.” Climate scientists say the world must keep the average global temperature from rising more than 1.5C (2.7F) compared with the pre-industrial era, or risk catastrophically more dangerous effects of climate change. Upon rejoining the global effort to confront the climate crisis, Joe Biden vowed that the US would cut emissions by 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Perhaps the best hope of achieving that goal is embedded in legislation pending before Congress that must overcome the objections of a coal-state senator and razor-thin Democratic majorities. If enacted, Castor said the plan to slash planet-heating emissions by accelerating America’s transition away from fossil fuels would be “the most important and far-reaching clean energy and climate bill ever passed by the US Congress”. But with days left before Biden is expected to depart for the summit, significant obstacles remain. Senator Joe Manchin, one of the party’s last remaining holdouts, made clear that he would not support a proposed clean electricity program, effectively gutting the most powerful piece of Democrats’ climate plan. The $150bn proposal, known as the Clean Electricity Performance Program, used a carrot-and-stick approach to reward energy utilities that transitioned from coal and natural gas toward clean power sources like wind, solar and nuclear energy, and penalizing those that do not. Now White House officials and congressional negotiators are scrambling to salvage pieces of the plan while finding alternative policies that will keep the US on track to meet the president’s emissions targets, including, potentially, a tax on carbon dioxide pollution. “It’s clear that investing in clean electricity is one of the most effective ways to unlock emission reductions and create good-paying jobs across our economy, which is why we’ve fought to include a robust Clean Electricity Performance Program in the Build Back Better Act,” Castor said in a statement following news of Manchin’s objection to the program. “Every step we take now to clean up our electricity sector will make a world of difference in the decades to come – and we cannot afford to keep kicking the can down the road.” After the Democratic takeover of the House in 2018, Castor was tapped to lead the newly created House select committee on the climate crisis. Its task was to conduct research and hearings that would educate the public about the threat posed by climate change and pave the way for mitigation legislation. Last year, the panel’s Democratic members released a sprawling climate plan that aimed to put the nation on the path to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It also aimed to make environmental justice a priority by focusing on the communities that are the most vulnerable to climate change. A summer of devastating heatwaves, wildfires and hurricanes has made the risk of inaction painfully clear to Americans across the country, Castor said, speaking from Tampa, Florida, where rising sea levels are no longer a threat but a costly reality for many residents. “When you have farmers whose crops or livestock have been flooded out or dropping from an extreme heat, or wildfires are burning through your town, or your electric grid isn’t resilient and people die in Texas because of a cold snap, that’s a wake-up call,” Castor said. “And I think now people are really looking at policymakers and asking, ‘What are you going to do about it?’” Republicans remain a chief obstacle to Democrats’ climate goals. After years of denialism, there is a growing acceptance of climate science among rank-and-file Republicans, particularly those representing frontline districts battered by climate-fueled disasters. And yet, the party remains largely opposed to plans to stop burning fossil fuels, which climate scientists say is the most efficient and effective strategy to guard against an even hotter planet. Castor said Republicans are missing a once-in-a-generation economic opportunity. Democrats have touted the transition to clean energy as an economic boon, with the president repeatedly promising “jobs, jobs, jobs”. “As clean energy grows in districts across the country, you’ll see more Republicans finally understanding it creates jobs and is less costly for the folks they represent,” Castor predicted. “That’s kind of the only pathway out of the trap they’ve gotten themselves into – to talk about climate but not do anything about it.” Democrats face a difficult electoral map in 2022, with their control of both chambers at risk. Many activists and Democratic lawmakers believe they have one, perhaps fleeting, chance to aggressively confront climate change before possibly losing their majorities to Republicans, who are far less likely to act on the crisis. Castor believes that the Democrats’ spending bill cannot be the last legislative action taken by this Congress. But she is less concerned by the political deadline than the scientific one. Despite the difficulty of finding a consensus among Democrats on climate legislation, Castor believes there is more Congress can do this term. As an example, she pointed to a funding bill passed by the House that aims to minimize the carbon footprint of the Department of Defense, by making military bases more resilient and bolstering investments in research to better understand the security implications posed by climate change. At the same time, she expects the president will continue to use his executive authority and the rule-making powers of the Environmental Protection Agency to combat climate change. “We’ll have a lot more to do,” she said. “Even if we pass the Build Back Better Act as it is, that doesn’t really get us to net zero by 2050, which is the goal.” Democrats are increasingly optimistic that they will send Biden to Glasgow with an agreement that proves the US is capable of making good on its climate promises. How Democrats accomplish this – and whether they can do it by 31 October, when the summit is due to begin – is unclear.",1
environment/2021/jul/01/australia-ranks-last-for-climate-action-among-un-member-countries,Environment,environment/2021/jul/01/australia-ranks-last-for-climate-action-among-un-member-countries,Nation scores just 10 out of 100 on tackling fossil fuel emissions in new report on sustainable development goals,"Australia has been ranked last for climate action out of nearly 200 countries in a report assessing progress towards global sustainable development goals. The Sustainable Development Report 2021, first reported by Renew Economy, scored Australia last out of 193 United Nations member countries for action taken to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. A database shows Australia received a score of just 10 out of 100 in an assessment of fossil fuel emissions, emissions associated with imports and exports, and policies for pricing carbon. Second last was Brunei, which was ranked behind Qatar and Norway. Richie Merzian, a climate expert at the Australia Institute, said the result was unsurprising. “Australia has received similar rankings from other comparable studies, including the Climate Change Performance Index, which last year ranked Australia second last behind only Trump’s America,” he said. “The federal government has no climate and energy policy and instead has cherry-picked technologies, many of which support the fossil fuel industry.” The report noted Australia had not committed to achieving netzero carbon emissions by 2050. Scott Morrison has instead signalled Australia wants to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible and “preferably” by 2050. The most recent emissions data, released by the government in late May, showed Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions were at the lowest levels in 30 years as the coronavirus pandemic put a handbrake on fossil fuel burning in the transport sector and slowed economic activity. In a statement at the time, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said those levels were despite “upward pressure from growth in exports and industry”. The Sustainable Development Report tracks countries’ progress towards the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals, which include quality education, gender equality, wiping out poverty, creating sustainable cities and communities, and affordable and clean energy. Australia ranked 35th overall, performing strongly on health and wellbeing, economic growth, education and clean water and sanitation. For clean energy, Australia was listed as having “major challenges” but recorded a moderate improvement over the past 12 months. The report says countries should not allow the Covid-19 pandemic to lead to a prolonged reversal in progress towards the goals. “International commitments, for instance towards climate neutrality, must be rapidly accompanied by transformative actions and investments,” the report says. “Large fiscal packages of major economies present an opportunity to foster a green, digital, and inclusive recovery.”",10
environment/2021/aug/10/nsw-transport-minister-wants-federal-government-to-use-electric-vehicles-in-fleet,Environment,environment/2021/aug/10/nsw-transport-minister-wants-federal-government-to-use-electric-vehicles-in-fleet,Andrew Constance says the second-hand market for EVs could be driven by state and federal government adoption of the new technology ,"New South Wales transport minister, Andrew Constance, has urged the Morrison government to accelerate the uptake of electric vehicles in Australia by using them for federal government fleets. Speaking at a Smart Energy Council summit, Constance said state and federal governments should “drive the second-hand market” by buying up electric vehicles in order to lower the price. “The best way to drive the second-hand market is for government fleets to move entirely to electric vehicles,” he said. “[In NSW], we’ve set in place a very clear interim target of 50% in the initial stages of government procurement to drive the second hand car market. That will also ensure it drives down the price point in terms of the EV market.” Asked specifically about what more the federal government could do in this space, Constance said he was disappointed by comments from federal counterparts that suggested EVs were only for the wealthy. “I was a bit disheartened to hear the federal minister [Angus Taylor] say that EVs are luxury cars,” Constance said. “That’s just untrue.” He said the country needed “to do everything we can” to encourage fleet managers to move to EVs. “There’s fringe benefit tax arrangements that can assist with that, there’s other incentives that can assist with that at the national level,” he said. “Anything that can be done to ensure the commonwealth can assist with procurements, I think that’s really important.” Taylor, the federal minister for energy and emissions reduction, told the ABC in an interview about EVs in June that he did not want to subsidise “luxury cars”. “That’s just not something we’re going to do as a government,” he said. “People who have the money to buy the luxury car are welcome to go out and do that, and good on them.” Constance also criticised Victoria and South Australia for introducing road user charges on electric vehicles, saying it was the wrong starting point for states looking to make the transition. The NSW government has also considered a road user tax for zero and low-emissions cars, but announced in June it would be delayed for six years or until electric models made up 30% of sales. Constance said he had “a very strong view” that charging EV drivers when they were needed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions was “absolutely crazy and ridiculous”. Behyad Jafari, chair of the Electric Vehicle Council, told the summit 8,688 EVs had been sold in Australia so far this year. It is an increase on last year, when EVs made up 0.75% of new car sales, a lower rate than in comparable countries. “More affordable models are being made available to our market,” Jafari said. “We have seen some really great things in not just the last six months, if not the last 12 months.” “We’re now on track to more than double the electric vehicles we sold last year.”",1
environment/2021/nov/16/indigenous-climate-activists-cop26-endangers-native-communities,Environment,environment/2021/nov/16/indigenous-climate-activists-cop26-endangers-native-communities,Schemes such as carbon trading favored by polluting nations lead to ecologically destructive projects like biofuels and dams ,"Indigenous communities facing an upsurge in land grabs, water shortages and human rights violations as a result of the Cop26 deal have accused world leaders of sacrificing them in order to postpone meaningful climate action and shield corporate profits. The Glasgow deal creates a regulated global carbon trading market – a move widely supported by the world’s biggest polluters including the US – allowing countries to partially meet their climate targets by buying credits representing emission cuts by others. Critics warn that carbon markets incentivize countries and corporations to offset – rather than cut – emissions responsible for global heating by investing in so-called green energy projects like biofuel monocrops and hydroelectric dams, which are linked to environmental destruction, forced displacement, arbitrary arrests and even murder. In addition, such carbon credit schemes often rely on sequestering land, forests and rivers relied on by indigenous and local communities for food, water, medicine and spiritual traditions, and there is little evidence to suggest they lead to a genuine drop in emissions. In fact, global emissions have continued to soar since carbon credits were first incentivized under the voluntary Kyoto protocol in 1997, as have abuses against indigenous and rural communities defending land rights and natural resources. Now, indigenous communities fear what’s coming next as the scope and scale of the new global carbon market – introduced in article 6 of the Paris accords – is much wider. Far more countries and industries, including the US, Saudi Arabia and civil aviation, will participate. “Cop26 leaders signed an agreement that will entrench sacrificing Indigenous people … [but] failed to include real solutions to meet the climate chaos that many of our frontline Indigenous communities are facing,” said Thomas Joseph from the Hoopa tribe, located in California. “The leaders pushing for market-based solutions and the commodification of our Mother Earth are signing a death sentence.” Andrea Xieu, a spokesperson for the Mexican collective Futuros Indígenas (Indigenous Futures) described the deal as an embarrassment that illustrated the murky influence of fossil fuel companies in Glasgow. More than 500 fossil fuel lobbyists, affiliated with some of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies, were granted access to Cop26 – a larger number than any single country delegation. Meanwhile, indigenous people were mostly excluded, and their traditional knowledge on sustainable land and water management sidelined. “Indigenous nations were not part of the negotiations despite the fact that 80% of the planet’s biodiversity survives in our territories. The problem is not only the blah, blah, blah of politicians, but the bang, bang, bang of greenwashing that will continue to destroy our lives and territories,” said Xieu. At least 1,005 environmental and land rights defenders have been murdered since the Paris accords were signed six years ago, according to the international non-profit Global Witness. One in three of those killed were indigenous people. The dead include the Lenca leader Berta Cáceres, winner of the prestigious Goldman prize for environmental defenders, who was shot dead at her home in Honduras in March 2016 for opposing the construction of an internationally financed dam. Carbon trading is one of the so-called nature-based solutions to the climate crisis heavily promoted by big polluters at Cop26 as the silver bullet to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 with little pain for people in the global north. But critics say offsetting carbon is a false solution as it essentially allows polluters to keep polluting and thus net zero is not actually zero. “Net zero is a scam. It is used as a smokescreen to avoid actual transition away from fossil fuels and carry on business as usual by relying on unproven carbon capture technologies and offsets,” said Sebastien Duyck, senior attorney from the Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL) and an official observer. At the last minute, activists helped secure a handful of new safeguards for article 6 such as an independent grievance mechanism. But according to Duyck, carbon markets remain counterproductive and fundamentally harmful. Investors will still be able to qualify for incentives without complying with international treaties that require indigenous people to be properly consulted. “Article 6 creates a way for public and private investors to weaponize the Paris agreement for the sake of profits at the cost of local communities and indigenous people’s rights,” added Duyck. Another nature-based solution popular with polluters is the creation of carbon sinks through massive reforestation and afforestation programs. While not part of the official Cop26 deal, according to some calculations countries collectively pledged to plant enough trees to cover a landmass the size of Australia. However, that threatens livelihoods, food security and sacred traditions of indigenous communities and small-scale farmers who use much of the land being earmarked for tree planting. “Nature-based solutions sound nice, but they won’t solve the climate crisis even if you’re willing to sacrifice indigenous people and local communities,” said Sophie Grig from Survival International. “Net zero is disingenuous and a diversion from doing what needs to be done now: stop burning fossil fuels and protect indigenous land rights.” Also gaining traction is the UN’s 30 by 30 initiative – a plan to conserve 30% of the planet’s land and seas by 2030 through conservation measures like doubling protected nature reserves, which Joe Biden has promised to implement as part of his climate strategy. Speaking in Glasgow last week, Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, said 30 by 30 would be the biggest planet grab in history, leading to millions of people being displaced. Another big worry for indigenous communities is Cop26’s failure to help those on the frontline recover, rebuild and adapt to global heating. Rich polluting countries succeeded in obstructing the creation of a loss and damage fund to compensate communities who have already lost their homes and livelihoods from floods, droughts, heatwaves and rising sea levels. After almost 15 years of discussion and delays on loss and damage, the Glasgow deal mandates further dialogue. “The results of this Cop are not a surprise, but they represent the state of the governments and their feelings, which are completely at odds with wider civil society demanding concrete actions and urgent measures,” said Calfin Lafkenche, a Mapuche organiser with the Minga movement, an indigenous solidarity network. In response to the acts and omissions at Cop26, the women of the Kichwa Indigenous People of Sarayaku, located in Ecuador, declared a state of emergency, citing the summit’s failure to address the existential threats posed to them by fossil fuel companies and the climate crisis. In a statement, the women said: “Indigenous peoples resist the extraction of natural resources with our bodies, with our lives. Our contribution to tackling climate change must be recognized. Our solutions must be heard.”",2
environment/2021/jul/18/how-data-could-save-earth-from-climate-change,Environment,environment/2021/jul/18/how-data-could-save-earth-from-climate-change,"Using a name inspired by Indonesian farmers, Subak will share information and fund hi-tech solutions to fight global heating","As monikers go, Subak may seem an odd choice for a new organisation that aims to accelerate hi-tech efforts to combat the climate crisis. The name is Indonesian, it transpires, and refers to an ancient agricultural system that allows farmers to co-ordinate their efforts when irrigating and growing crops. “Subak allows farmers to carefully synchronise their use of water and so maximise rice production,” said Bryony Worthington, founder and board member of the new, not-for-profit climate action group. “And that is exactly what we are going to do – with data. By sharing and channelling data, we can maximise our efforts to combat carbon emissions and global warming. Data is going to be the new water, in other words.” Subak will be officially launched on Monday and will select and fund non-profit groups, working around the world, to combat the climate crisis. Early start-ups already helped by Subak include one group that is assisting UK local authorities to boost electric car use, while another is using accurate weather forecasts to make best use of solar power across Britain and limit fossil fuel burning to generate electricity. These efforts are being launched after a week of headlines that have highlighted how perilous life on Earth is becoming as global heating grips the planet. Floods in Germany and Belgium left more than 150 dead; scientists revealed that the Brazilian rainforest now emits more carbon dioxide than it absorbs; and fires devastated vast tracts of Californian forests. In each case, scientists warned that rising temperatures – triggered by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere – are likely to have played a key role in bringing about these catastrophes. Urgent action is clearly needed, says Lady Worthington, a noted climate activist and lead author of the team which drafted the UK’s 2008 Climate Change Act, legislation that required the UK to reduce its carbon emissions by at least 80% of their 1990 levels. At the time, Worthington was working with Friends of the Earth but was seconded to government to help design the legislation. For her efforts, she was made a peer in 2010. Since then, Worthington has continued in the battle against the climate crisis, and in 2019 she read Harvard academic Shoshana Zuboff’s book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism ,which focuses – disapprovingly – on hi-tech companies’ growing use of personal data to make money. “It woke me up to the fact a whole new world of digital tools was being deployed to generate profits,” says Worthington. “I realised it would be better if those tools could be used to save the planet – to protect the global commons – and not merely to boost share value.” Worthington contacted Gi Fernando, a tech entrepreneur, and the pair hatched the idea of Subak, which has since been given funding by the Quadrature Climate Foundation (QCF) that was recently set up by the London investment management company, Quadrature Capital. Its aim is to provide initial funding to help groups establish themselves but also to give expert guidance over legal, management and other issues. “When you start up a company or group, you are quite alone,” says Fernando. “So if you have a community around you that can offer help – HR, finance, tools – that is incredibly helpful. And then, once that group gets on their feet, they can then start to help other startup entrepreneurs wanting to open new avenues in order to help fight climate change.” Fernando’s words are echoed by several of the groups that Subak has already helped to set up, such as Open Climate Fix. This aims to reduce carbon emissions by improving weather forecasts to make the best use of solar power plants – whose effectiveness is reduced when the weather is cloudy. “If we get very good data about forthcoming cloud cover, we will know exactly how much solar-generated electricity can be provided in the UK on a given day,” said Open Climate Fix’s co-founder, Jack Kelly. “That will mean we will not need to generate unnecessary electricity from other sources – in particular fossil fuel sources such as gas – because we have underestimated the solar power we will get that day. That will help to reduce carbon emissions.” Subak’s provision of engineers and software experts who have turned weather satellite images into cloud cover forecasts was a critical piece of assistance, added Kelly. A similar tale is told by Richard Allan of New AutoMotive, which is monitoring how electric cars are being taken up in communities across the UK. Factors include vehicle use, sales patterns and favourite types of cars and trucks. That data can be fed to local authorities to ensure charging stations, battery replacement services and other resources are provided to maximise take-up of electric cars. “Replacing petrol and diesel vehicles with electric versions as quickly as possible is going to be extremely important in reducing carbon emissions,” says Allan. “And data about take-up rates in communities will be vital in achieving that goal.” This view is endorsed by Worthington. “Just as a major corporation has lots of different companies under its control, Subak is going to help set up lots of new outfits, each aimed at boosting efforts to control climate change. “We are going to be the Diageo of climate protection, though we will not be co-ordinating drink production. We will be generating precious data about the climate.” 415: The number of parts per million of carbon dioxide that make up the atmosphere. Before the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700s, the global average amount of carbon dioxide was about 280ppm. Burning fossil fuels has since added a further 135ppm and if global energy demand continues to grow and is met mostly with fossil fuels, that figure could exceed 900ppm by 2100. 3.6mm: The estimated increase each year in sea level, according to measurements of tide gauges and satellite data. This is a result of human-induced warming of the planet. It is projected that the sea level will rise a further 40 to 80cm by 2100, although future ice sheet melt could make these values considerably higher. 43.1 billion: In 2019 that was the number of tons of carbon dioxide from human activities that were emitted into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that absorbs heat and release it gradually over time, like bricks in a fireplace after the fire goes out. Current increases in greenhouse gases have tipped the Earth’s energy budget out of balance, trapping additional heat and raising Earth’s average temperature. 28 trillion: The estimated numbers of tons of ice that our planet has lost between 1994 and 2017. Global warming has a particularly severe impact at higher latitudes and this has been most noticeable in the Arctic. Scientists worry that as ice melts, less solar radiation will be reflected back into space and temperatures will rise even faster. Ice loss will become increasingly severe as a result.

technology/2021/jun/14/tesla-will-resume-accepting-bitcoin-when-it-uses-more-clean-energy-says-musk,Technology,technology/2021/jun/14/tesla-will-resume-accepting-bitcoin-when-it-uses-more-clean-energy-says-musk,Tesla CEO says transactions made in digital currency will resume once crypto mining is greener,"The price of bitcoin hit a three-week high on Monday, climbing back above $40,000 after Elon Musk said that Tesla would resume allowing transactions made in the digital currency once crypto mining becomes greener. The electric car company’s latest change of direction on its acceptance of bitcoin once again highlighted the continuing ability of Tesla’s billionaire chief executive to influence the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing bitcoin transactions,” Musk said in a tweet on Sunday. The price of one bitcoin climbed to a high of $41,033 (£29,063) on Monday before slipping back to $40,580, still up more than 12% from its price before Musk’s tweet. Musk, one of the most high-profile proponents of cryptocurrencies, also said that Tesla sold about 10% of its holdings to confirm bitcoin could be liquidated easily without moving the market. He announced in May that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin for car purchases, citing long-brewing environmental concerns for a swift reversal in the company’s position on the cryptocurrency. In February, Tesla revealed it had bought $1.5bn of bitcoin and would accept it as a form of payment for cars. But the cryptocurrency’s production is at odds with the company’s mission toward a “zero-emission future”. Bitcoin fell more than 10% after Musk’s tweet in May. He said that he believed cryptocurrency had a promising future but it could not be at great cost to the environment. The energy used to produce bitcoin alone is equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of Argentina, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, a tool from researchers at Cambridge University that measures the currency’s energy use. Bitcoin mining – the process in which a bitcoin is awarded to a computer that solves a complex series of algorithms – is deeply energy-intensive. Because there is a finite number of bitcoins that can be mined – 21m – computers have to solve harder and harder algorithms in order to get bitcoin. The special equipment and intense processing power use a lot of electricity – as much as some entire countries. The concerns over energy use aside, cryptocurrencies have split opinion among investors and financial regulators for other reasons, including the rollercoaster ride sparked by their frequent swings in price. Despite bitcoin’s recent rise, it is still trading about a third lower than the record high of $63,000, which it reached in April. A year ago, bitcoin’s value was under $9,500. Earlier in June, the Central American country of El Salvador became the first in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, as part of its technology-loving president’s proposals to use the cryptocurrency to promote “financial inclusion”, investment and economic development. However, others remain unconvinced, and cryptocurrencies remain controversial. Global regulators are sceptical, on account of their volatility and vulnerability to theft or hacking. The Bank of England has previously warned that the rise of digital currencies could set off a flood of withdrawals from high-street banks, risking financial stability and the wider economy, and cautioned that investors risk losing their money. According to various measures, bitcoin is undervalued at current prices, said Alexandra Clark, a sales trader at the digital asset broker GlobalBlock, although she added: “Many analysts are still on the fence when it comes to determining whether the digital asset is ready to continue its uptrend.” Tesla’s decision to sell 10% of its bitcoin holding “has brought about fresh accusations of pumping and dumping by Musk and reiterated the need for an investigation by the SEC [US Securities and Exchange Commission],” Clark said. The US securities watchdog warned Tesla last year that Musk had twice violated a settlement requiring his tweets and material public communications to be preapproved by company lawyers, the Wall Street Journal reported at the start of June.",1
environment/2021/nov/21/climate-denial-far-right-immigration,Environment,environment/2021/nov/21/climate-denial-far-right-immigration,The wrapping of ecological disaster with fears of rampant immigration is a narrative that has flourished in far-right fringe movements in Europe and the US,"Standing in front of the partial ruins of Rome’s Colosseum, Boris Johnson explained that a motive to tackle the climate crisis could be found in the fall of the Roman empire. Then, as now, he argued, the collapse of civilization hinged on the weakness of its borders. “When the Roman empire fell, it was largely as a result of uncontrolled immigration – the empire could no longer control its borders, people came in from the east and all over the place,” the British prime minister said in an interview on the eve of crucial UN climate talks in Scotland. Civilization can go into reverse as well as forwards, as Johnson told it, with Rome’s fate offering grave warning as to what could happen if global heating is not restrained. This wrapping of ecological disaster with fears of rampant immigration is a narrative that has flourished in far-right fringe movements in Europe and the US and is now spilling into the discourse of mainstream politics. Whatever his intent, Johnson was following a current of rightwing thought that has shifted from outright dismissal of climate change to using its impacts to fortify ideological, and often racist, battle lines. Representatives of this line of thought around the world are, in many cases, echoing eco-fascist ideas that themselves are rooted in an earlier age of blood-and-soil nationalism. In the US, a lawsuit by the Republican attorney general of Arizona has demanded the building of a border wall to prevent migrants coming from Mexico as these people “directly result in the release of pollutants, carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere”. In Spain, Santiago Abascal, leader of the populist Vox party, has called for a “patriotic” restoration of a “green Spain, clean and prosperous”. In the UK, the far-right British National party has claimed to be the “only true green party” in the country due to its focus on migration. And in Germany, the rightwing populist party Alternative for Germany has tweaked some of its earlier mockery of climate science with a platform that warns “harsh climatic conditions” in Africa and the Middle East will see a “gigantic mass migration towards European countries”, requiring toughened borders. Meanwhile, France’s National Front, once a bastion of derisive climate denial, has founded a green wing called New Ecology, with Marine Le Pen, president of the party, vowing to create the “world’s leading ecological civilization” with a focus on locally grown foods. “Environmentalism [is] the natural child of patriotism, because it’s the natural child of rootedness,” Le Pen said in 2019, adding that “if you’re a nomad, you’re not an environmentalist. Those who are nomadic … do not care about the environment; they have no homeland.” Le Pen’s ally Hervé Juvin, a National Rally MEP, is seen as an influential figure on the European right in promoting what he calls “nationalistic green localism”. Simply ignoring or disparaging the science isn’t the effective political weapon it once was. “We are seeing very, very little climate denialism in conversations on the right now,” said Catherine Fieschi, a political analyst and founder of Counterpoint, who tracks trends in populist discourse. But in place of denial is a growing strain of environmental populism that has attempted to dovetail public alarm over the climate crisis with disdain for ruling elites, longing for a more traditional embrace of nature and kin and calls to banish immigrants behind strong borders. Millions of people are already being displaced from their homes, predominately in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, due to disasters worsened by climate change such as flooding, storms and wildfires. In August, the United Nations said Madagascar was on the brink of the world’s first “climate change famine”. The number of people uprooted around the world will balloon further, to as many as 1.2 billion by 2050 by some estimates, and while most will move within their own countries, many millions are expected to seek refuge across borders. This mass upending of lives is set to cause internal and external conflicts that the Pentagon, among others, has warned will escalate into violence. The response to this trend on the right has led to what academics Joe Turner and Dan Bailey call “ecobordering”, where restrictions on immigration are seen as vital to protect the nativist stewardship of nature and where the ills of environmental destruction are laid upon those from developing countries, ignoring the far larger consumptive habits of wealthy nations. In an analysis of 22 far-right parties in Europe, the academics found this thinking is rife among rightwing parties and “portrays effects as causes and further normalizes racist border practices and colonial amnesia within Europe”. Turner, an expert in politics and migration at the University of York, said the link between climate and migration is “an easy logic” for politicians such as Johnson as it plays into longstanding tropes on the right that overpopulation in poorer countries is a leading cause of environmental harm. More broadly, it is an attempt by the right to seize the initiative on environmental issues that have for so long been the preserve of center-left parties and conservationists. “The far right in Europe has an anti-immigration platform, that’s their bread and butter, so you can see it as an electoral tactic to start talking about green politics,” Turner said, adding that migrants are being blamed in two ways – first, for moving to countries with higher emissions and then adding to those emissions, as rightwing figures in Arizona have claimed; and secondly for supposedly bringing destructive, polluting habits with them from their countries of origin. A mixture of this Malthusian and ethno-nationalist thinking is being distilled into political campaigning, as in   a political pamphlet described in Turner and Bailey’s research paper from SVP, the largest party in Switzerland’s federal assembly, which shows a city crowded by people and cars belching out pollution, with a tagline that translates to “stop massive immigration”. A separate campaign ad by SVP claims that 1 million migrants will result in thousands of miles of new roads and that “anyone who wants to protect the environment in Switzerland must fight against mass immigration”. The far right depict migrants as being “essentially poor custodians of their own lands and then treating European nature badly as well”, Turner said. “So you get these headlines around asylum seekers eating swans, all these ridiculous scaremongering tactics. But they play into this idea that by stopping immigrants coming here, you are actually supporting a green project.” Experts are clear that the main instigators of the climate crisis are wealthy people in wealthy countries. The richest 1% of the world’s population were responsible for the emission of more than twice as much carbon dioxide as the poorer half of the world from 1990 to 2015, research has found, with people in the US causing the highest level of per capita emissions in the world. Adding new arrivals to high-emitting countries doesn’t radically ramp up these emissions at the same rate: a study by Utah State University found  that immigrants are typically “using less energy, driving less, and generating less waste” than native-born Americans. Still, the idea of personal sacrifice is hard for many to swallow. While there is strengthening acceptance of climate science among the public, and a restlessness that governments have done so little to constrain global heating, support for climate polices plummets when it comes to measures that involve the taxing of gasoline or other impositions. According to a research paper co-authored by Fieschi, this has led to a situation where “detractors are taking up the language of freedom fighters”. “We are seeing the growth of accusations of climate hysteria as a way for elites to exploit ordinary people,” Fieschi said. “The solutions that are talked about involve spending more money on deserving Americans and deserving Germans and so on, and less on refugees. It’s ‘yes, we will need to protect people, but let’s protect our people.’” This backlash is visible in protest movements such as the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) in France, which became the longest-running protest movement in the country since the second world war by railing against, among other things, a carbon tax placed on fuel. Online, favored targets such as Greta Thunberg or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been shown in memes as Nazis or devils intent on impoverishing western civilization through their supposedly radical ideas to combat climate change. Fieschi said the right’s interaction with climate is far more than just about borders – it is animating fears that personal freedoms are under attack from a cosseted, liberal elite. “You see these quite obviously populist arguments in the US and Europe that a corrupt elite, the media and government have no idea what ordinary people’s lives are like as they impose these stringent climate policies,” said Fieschi, whose research has analyzed the climate conversation on the right taking place on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms. This sort of online chatter has escalated since the Covid-19 pandemic started, Fieschi said, and is being fed along a line of influence that begins with small, conspiratorial rightwing groups spreading messages that are then picked up by what she calls “middle of the tail” figures with thousands of followers, and then in turn disseminated by large influencers and into mainstream center-right politics. “There are these conspiratorial accusations that Covid is a dry run for restrictions that governments want to impose with the climate emergency, that we need to fight for our freedoms on wearing masks and on all these climate rules,” Fieschi said. “There is a yearning for a pre-Covid life and a feeling climate policies will just cause more suffering. “What’s worrying,” Fieschi continued, “is that more reasonable parts of the right, mainstream conservatives and Republicans, are being drawn to this. They will say they don’t deny climate change but then tap into these ideas.” She said center-right French politicians have started disparaging climate activists as “miserabilists”, while Armin Laschet, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union who sought to succeed Angela Merkel, has said Germany should focus on its own industry and people in the face of cascading global crises. The interplay between environmentalism and racism has some of its deepest roots in the US, where some of the conservation movement’s totemic figures of the past embraced views widely regarded as abhorrent today. Wilderness was something viewed in the 19th century as bound in rugged, and exclusively white, masculinity, and manifest destiny demanded the expansion of a secure frontier. John Muir, known as the father of national parks in the US, described native Americans as “dirty” and said they “seemed to have no right place in the landscape”. Madison Grant, a leading figure in the protection of the American bison and the establishment of Glacier national park, was an avowed eugenicist who argued for “inferior” races to be placed into ghettoes and successfully lobbied for Ota Benga, a Congolese man, to be put on display alongside apes at the Bronx Zoo. This focus on racial hierarchies would come to be adopted into the ideology of the Nazis – themselves avowed conservationists. There has been something of a reckoning of this troubling past in recent years – a bronze statue of Theodore Roosevelt on horseback flanked by a native American man and an African man is to be removed from the front of the American Museum of Natural History in New York and at least one conservation group named after the slaveholder and anti-abolitionist John James Audubon is changing its name. But elsewhere, themes of harmful overpopulation have been picked up by a resurgent right from a liberal environmental movement that now largely demurs from the topic. Republicans, aware that many of their own younger voters are turned off by the relentless climate denial as they see their futures wreathed in wildfire smoke and flood water, have sensed an opportunity. “The right is reclaiming that older Malthusian population rhetoric and is using that as a cudgel in green terms rather than unpopular racist terms,” said Blair Taylor, program director at the Institute for Social Ecology, an educational and research body. “It’s weird that this has become a popular theme in the US west because the west is sparsely populated and that hasn’t slowed environmental destruction,” he added. “But this is about speaking to nativist fears, it isn’t about doing anything to solve the problem.” The spearhead for modern nativism in the US is, of course, Donald Trump who has, along with an often dismissive stance towards climate science itself, sought to portray migrants from Mexico and Central America as criminals and “animals” while vowing to restore clean air and water to deserving American citizens. If there is to be another iteration of a Trump presidency, or a successful campaign by one of his acolytes, the scientific denial may be dialed down somewhat while retaining the reflex nativism. The Republican lawsuit in Arizona may be a prelude to an ecological reframing of Trump’s fetish for border walls should the former president run again for office in 2024, with migrants again the target. “We will see weird theories that will spread blame in all the wrong directions,” Taylor said. “More walls, more borders, more exclusion – that’s most likely the way we are heading.” A recasting of environmentalism in this way has already branched out in different forms throughout the US right, spanning gun-toting preppers who view nature as a bastion to be defended from interlopers – “a ‘back to the land’ ideology where you are an earner and provider, not a not soft-handed soy boy,” as Taylor describes it – to the vaguely mystic “wellness” practitioners who have risen to prominence by spreading false claims over the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines. The latter group, Taylor said, includes those who have a fascination with organic farming, Viking culture, extreme conspiracy theories such as the QAnon fantasy and a rejection of science and reason in favour of discovering an “authentic self”. These disparate facets are all embodied, he said, in Jake Angeli, the so-called QAnon shaman who was among the rioters who stormed the US Capitol on 6 January. Angeli, who became famous for wearing horns and a bearskin headdress during the violent insurrection, was sentenced to 41 months in prison over his role in the riot. He gained media attention for refusing to eat the food served in jail because it was not organic. Angeli, who previously attended a climate march to promote his conspiracy-laden YouTube channel and said he is in favor of “cleansed ecosystems”, has been described as an eco-fascist, a term that has also been applied to Patrick Crusius, the Dallas man accused of killing 23 people in a mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, in 2019. In a document published online shortly before the shooting, Crusius wrote: “The environment is getting worse by the year … So the next logical step is to decrease the number of people in America using resources. If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can become more sustainable.” The shooting came just a few months after the terrorist massacre of 49 people in two mosques in Christchurch in New Zealand, with the perpetrator describing himself as an eco-fascist unhappy about the birthrate of immigrants. Such extreme, violent acts erupting from rightwing eco-populist beliefs are still rare but the “‘alt-right’ has been adept at taking concerns and making them mainstream”, said Taylor. “It has fostered the idea that nature is a place of savage survival that brings us back to original society, that nature itself is fascist because there is no equality in nature. That’s what they believe.” Advocates for those fleeing climate-induced disasters hope there will be a shift in the other direction, with some advocating for a new international refugee framework. The UN convention on refugees does not recognize climate change, and its effects, as a reason for countries to provide shelter to refugees. An escalation in forced displacement from drought, floods and other calamities will put further onus on the need for reform. But opening up the convention for a revamp could see it wound back as much as it could be expanded, given the growing ascendancy of populism and authoritarianism in many countries. “The big players aren’t invested in changing any of the definitions around refugees – in fact the US and UK are making it even more difficult to claim asylum,” said Turner. “I think what you’re going to see is internally displaced people increasing and the burden, as it already is, falling on neighbors in the global south.” Ultimately, the extent of the suffering caused by global heating, and the increasingly severe responses required to deal with that, will help determine the reactionary response. While greater numbers of people will call for climate action, any restrictions imposed by governments will provide a sense of vindication to rightwingers warning of overreaching elites. “My sense is that we won’t do enough to avoid others bearing the brunt of this,” Fieschi said. “Solidarity has its limits, after all. Sure, you want good things for the children of the world. But ultimately you will put your children first.” Research for this article was made possible with the support of the Heinrich Boell Foundation, Washington DC’s Transatlantic Media Fellowship",7

Australia was among a handful of major fossil fuel exporting nations that sought to weaken the conclusions of the report, Greenpeace’s investigative arm, Unearthed, said on Thursday. It released a report based on leaked documents related to the Working Group III paper on solutions to the climate crisis being prepared by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Guardian Australia has not seen the leaked documents. Greenpeace said only excerpts were being released due to “a justified concern in the scientific community about the publication of leaked reports from the IPCC before the scientific process for reaching their conclusions is complete”. The Working Group III report will not be finished until March 2022. Australia, which is the world’s largest coal exporter and second-largest gas exporter, features prominently in the Unearthed report as rejecting the IPCC’s analysis that fossil fuels urgently need to be phased out of the world’s energy systems. The draft IPCC report states coal- and gas-fired power stations need to be phased out and replaced by low- or zero-carbon electricity sources, according to Unearthed. Longer term, technologies such as hydrogen fuels or the capture and storage of carbon emissions from power plants should be tested and improved. Phasing out fossil fuel power in the near term, the IPCC states, should be “accompanied by efforts to improve and test out options that will be important later on, including hydrogen or biofuels in cars and trucks, and fossil power plants, bioenergy power plants or refineries with CCUS [carbon capture utilisation and storage].” Australia, however, rejected this analysis, suggesting in comments to the draft that carbon capture could be deployed in the near term to avoid phasing out coal and gas power, Unearthed claims. The report cites a senior official at Australia’s Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources as saying: “These remarks confuse the objective (eliminating emissions) with the means ‘retiring existing coal-fired power’. CCUS remains relevant to zero emissions”. In a separate intervention, the Australian official suggested the country be deleted from a list of the world’s major producers and consumers of coal – despite Australia being the fifth-largest coal producer in the world between 2018 and 2021 – because the nation does not consume as much coal as other countries, Unearthed says. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Australia also objected to the IPCC’s analysis that lobbying by fossil fuel companies had weakened action on climate change in Australia and the US in particular. “One factor limiting the ambition of climate policy has been the ability of incumbent industries to shape government action on climate change … Campaigns by oil and coal companies against climate action in the US and Australia are perhaps the most well-known and largely successful of these”, the draft IPCC report states, citing academic references, according to Unearthed. But despite those references, the Australian official requested “deleting this political viewpoint made to seem factual”, Unearthed says. A spokesperson for Angus Taylor, Australia’s energy and emissions reduction minister, said Australia’s position was not accurately reported. “All comments received by the IPCC are published with their reports as they are finalised. This ensures complete transparency,” they said in a statement. “The assertion that commenting on a draft is somehow ‘interference’ is categorically false.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning and afternoon email newsletters App: download our free app and never miss the biggest stories Social: follow us on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook or Twitter Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The Australian government under Scott Morrison has stated it is unlikely to lift the country’s 2030 goal of cutting 2005-level emissions by 26-28% and continues to debate internally whether to accept a target of carbon neutrality by 2050. That issue of net zero emissions also features in the Unearthed report, indicating the use of “carbon offsetting” in allowing companies and countries to reduce their emissions without phasing out fossil fuels will feature prominently at the Glasgow climate talks that begin on 31 October. According to Unearthed, Australia in its submission challenged the IPCC assertion that “a growing body of research – usually drawn from experience with existing carbon markets and the Kyoto mechanisms – highlights environmental integrity risks associated with using Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes [a form of carbon credit] under the Paris Agreement given the challenges that the diverse scope, metrics, types and timeframes of NDC targets pose for robust accounting (Schneider and La Hoz Theuer 12 2019) and the potential for transfers of ‘hot air’ as occurred under the Kyoto Protocol (La Hoz Theuer et al 2019).” The Australian commentator inserted a note, according to Unearthed, stating: “Query the use of ‘growing’ (line 8) with reference to the body of research, as only 2 studies are referenced. Two studies does not seem a normal scale for a ‘growing body’ of research.” Greenpeace Australia Pacific’s chief executive, David Ritter, said the leaked documents suggested the Morrison government was attempting to “trainwreck global climate progress”. “What we see in these leaked documents is Morrison government officials in sabotage mode, rather than acting in good faith with the best interests of the Australian people to collaborate to secure ambitious global climate cooperation,” Ritter said in a statement. “Scott Morrison has rejected setting a stronger 2030 emissions reduction target for Australia and now we know his government is pushing back against key recommendations by the world’s leading climate science body on the need to phase out coal over the next decade.” Adam Bandt, the Australian Greens leader, said the Unearthed report showed the Coalition was “actively trying to prevent the rest of the world from stopping dangerous global heating”. Federal Labor’s shadow climate spokesperson, Chris Bowen, said: ‘It’s not just Australians Mr Morrison is trying to hoodwink – he’s also trying to deceive our friends and allies in the international community.”",0

The Australian Academy of Science is calling on the Morrison government to accelerate the country’s transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions in a report that examines what Australia could look like in a 3C world. The analysis paints a grim picture in which heatwaves in states such as Queensland would occur seven times a year and last for 16 days at a time, and unprecedented fire seasons such as the 2019-20 fire disaster become a regular occurrence. The report’s authors said what Australia and other countries did to reduce emissions over the next decade would be critical as it would determine what occurred in the second half of this century. “When we sum up what’s happening, we’re not doing enough and we have to change the game to avoid a very consequential future,” Prof Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, a biologist and climate scientist at the University of Queensland, said. The planet has already warmed by 1.1C since pre-industrial times and, based on current commitments by countries under the Paris agreement, is on track for an average 3C temperature rise. The report considers how that would affect Australia’s ecosystems, food production, cities and towns, and health and wellbeing – and what Australia’s contribution must be to ensure global heating remains well below 2C, as promised under the 2015 global climate deal. Prof Mark Howden, from the Australian National University Climate Change Institute, said Australians had already experienced increased heat and reductions in rainfall as a result of the climate crisis. He said a 3C world could lead to “heat stress” temperatures being a daily occurrence in northern parts of Australia. Nationally, what was once considered a hot year would become a cool year. He said this would pose significant challenges for food systems and human health but “there are adaptive measures we can put in place”, such as better warning systems for managing the health effects of heatwaves and floods, and designing clean and green hospitals “for the future and not the past”. While its assessment of a 3C world is bleak, the report paints a much more positive picture of what governments can do now and over the next decade to keep global heating to within 2C. The scientists write that Australia lags behind the best practice demonstrated by many other countries. Their 10 recommendations include a call for the Morrison government to accelerate the transition to net zero emissions “given how much Australia stands to lose if GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions are not reduced”. They also recommend governments improve their understanding of climate impacts, including tipping points and the compounding effects of multiple stressors at global heating of 2C or more, so that Australia can develop effective adaptation responses. The report calls for a systematic exploration of how Australia should prepare its food production and supply for a worsening climate crisis, and improved understanding of the risks of climate change to human health. Prof Frank Jotzo, from ANU’s Crawford School of Public Policy, said achieving the goals of the Paris agreement would require accelerated investment in renewable energy, energy storage and electricity transmission. He said reducing transport emissions, which account for about 19% of Australia’s current carbon pollution, was the next major and necessary step, and that an electric vehicle fleet would also present “a handy opportunity for decentralised electricity storage”. “The costs of reducing global emissions are much less than the cost of adapting to the impacts of unrestrained global warming,” Jotzo said. Prof Lesley Hughes, an ecologist and pro vice-chancellor at Macquarie University, said there were steps the Morrison government could take immediately to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles, rather than inhibit it. “Delay is as dangerous as denial,” she said. “The main message we would have for the federal government is that what we do, as well as the rest of the world, in the next decade ... that’s the critical thing.”",4
